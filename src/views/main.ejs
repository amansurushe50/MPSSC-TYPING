Everyone has tasted it. It is born in children. It goes to school with them, and is too often killed there by tired or practical teachers. But in some, it survives and unlike other delights it endures for life. To spend 50 or 60 years in studying the structure of fishes or the relation between logic and language, the history of the Incase or the rules of comets, the geometry of Non-euclidean space the literature of leei and or the anatomy of the brain, to acquire, systematize and record new knowledge of any subject without expectation of benefit-making expect by extending its range of understanding that is to pass a happy and valuable life, usually tempered at the close by regret that another 50 years could not be added, in which to learn more and still more. It is the purest and least selfish satisfaction known to man. The man must live his life satisfactory. Good will is the rational will. It is autonomous and self-legislative. I lays down its own laws. While obeying the maximum good will, man follows his own higher self. Thus, man is truly free in following the good will. Good will follows the categorical imperative, i.e., moral law, laid down by it. Moral law is to be followed out of pure respect for it. It is to be obeyed out of consciousness of duty and not due to emotions, feelings or desires. The true rule of life is Duty for dutys sake. Moral life is the life of pure reason. Feelings and emotions ought to be completely suppressed. To lead a moral life, the will ought to be guided by its own moral low or the categorical imperative. Kant says the will is free when it acts safely from the sense of duty. To give way to compassion or love is irrational and thus immoral. According to him an action is right or moral when it conforms to moral law; the person performs it out of pure respect for moral law duty for dutys sake. The moral law, the categorical imperative is pure form without matter. It cannot tell us what we should do or what we should not do. It simply tells us that actions should conform to the form. He does not tell us about the contents of our actions. He maintains that our actions should be in accordance with principles law.',

            'In recent months, the cryptocurrency market has experienced unprecedented levels of volatility, sparking widespread debate over the need for enhanced regulation and investor protection measures. The soaring prices and rapid fluctuations in the value of digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have left investors and policymakers alike grappling with the challenges posed by this emerging asset class. The cryptocurrency market, known for its decentralized nature and lack of regulatory oversight, has long been characterized by extreme price volatility. However, the recent surge in interest from retail and institutional investors, coupled with the entry of major financial institutions into the space, has amplified these fluctuations and raised concerns about market stability and investor risk. One of the main drivers of the cryptocurrency market volatility is its susceptibility to speculative trading and market manipulation. With relatively low liquidity and limited transparency compared to traditional financial markets, cryptocurrencies are particularly vulnerable to price manipulation by large traders or whales who hold significant amounts of digital assets. The sudden sell-offs or pump-and-dump schemes orchestrated by these actors can trigger sharp price swings, causing substantial losses for unsuspecting investors. Moreover, the lack of regulatory oversight has allowed for the proliferation of unscrupulous actors and fraudulent schemes in the cryptocurrency space. From Ponzi schemes to initial coin offering (ICO) scams, investors have fallen victim to a range of fraudulent activities, leading to substantial financial losses and eroding trust in the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies as an investment asset. In response to these challenges, policymakers and regulators around the world are increasingly calling for greater oversight of the cryptocurrency market to protect investors and ensure market integrity. Some countries have moved to implement stricter regulations governing cryptocurrency exchanges, requiring them to adhere to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) guidelines to prevent illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing. Others have proposed measures to enhance transparency and accountability in the cryptocurrency market, such as requiring issuers of digital assets to disclose key information to investors and regulators. Additionally, there have been calls for the establishment of regulatory frameworks to govern the trading and custody of cryptocurrencies, including licensing requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians. However, the push for increased regulation has sparked debate among industry stakeholders, with some arguing that excessive regulation could stifle innovation and hinder the growth of the cryptocurrency market. Proponents of self-regulation advocate for industry-led initiatives to promote best practices and standards for cryptocurrency exchanges and other market participants, while still ensuring adequate investor protection and market integrity. Furthermore, the debate over regulation is further complicated by the global nature of the cryptocurrency market, which operates across borders and jurisdictions with varying regulatory frameworks. Achieving consensus on international standards for cryptocurrency regulation presents a significant challenge, as countries grapple with differing approaches to regulating this nascent asset class. Despite the challenges and uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrency regulation, one thing remains clear: the need to strike a balance between fostering innovation and protecting investors in this rapidly evolving market. As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream acceptance and adoption, policymakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders must work together to develop comprehensive and effective regulatory frameworks that promote market stability, investor confidence, and responsible innovation. Only through collaboration and cooperation can we ensure the long-term viability and sustainability of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.',

            'The child when it is born is helpless. It has to be Nursed and looked after well. This means there should be a Family just as the child cannot live without the family. The family cannot live without a society. The family Small unit in society. It is in the family that people live More closely. The members of a family love one and all. In a happy and good family all the good virtues of human Being are there. The parents love their child and being him up with love and care. In order to bring up their child, they are prepared to make and sacrifice, it is in the family that the child learns good behaviours and all the qualities required for a good person. As such it is very important that the life in the family goes on and smoothly and happily. The modern society is more keen in helping families to love well. The happy and good life led in the families promotes The well being of all men. That family life is very much talked of in the modern society. Such a life is always said to be sacred. The child respects his elders and learns good manners. Family is the place where the child learns all the well good lessons in life. Since the child is born in the family and grows up pin the same, the human race can not continue without family. School is an equally a very fine social institution. If you were to analyze the lives of the lucky and unlucky individuals being commented on, you would find that the successful person is doing something right in each transaction, and the failure is repeating the same mistake time and again. Practice does not make perfect-only perfect practice makes perfect. Practice makes permanent whatever you do repeatedly. Some people keep practicing their mistakes and they become perfect in them. Their mistakes become perfect and automatic. Cultivating the habit is like plowing the field. It takes time. Habits generate other habits. Inspiration is what gets us started, motivation is what keeps us on track, and habit is what makes it automatic. The ability to show courage in the face of adversity; show self restraint in the face of temptation, choose happiness in the face of hurt, show character in the face of despair, and see opportunity in the face of obstacles are all valuable traits to possess. But these traits do not just appear, but they are the result of constant and consistent training, both mental and physical. It the face of adversity, our behaviour, whether positive or negative can only be what we have practiced. We are born to win but are conditioned to lose. We should ourselves find what is right practice and then decide whether to follow it or not.',

            'Inflationary pressures have been steadily mounting across economies worldwide, prompting central banks to reassess their policy strategies to mitigate the impact on consumers and maintain economic stability. As prices for goods and services continue to rise, central banks are facing increasing scrutiny and pressure to implement effective measures to address the situation. In recent months, inflation rates have surged in many countries, driven by a combination of factors including supply chain disruptions, soaring energy costs, and robust consumer demand. The COVID-19 pandemic-induced disruptions to global supply chains have exacerbated supply shortages, leading to higher production costs for businesses. Additionally, the rebound in consumer spending as economies reopen has fuelled demand-pull inflation, further driving up prices. Central banks, tasked with the responsibility of maintaining price stability and controlling inflation, are now faced with the challenge of calibrating their monetary policies to navigate this inflationary environment. Traditional monetary policy tools such as interest rate adjustments and asset purchases are being carefully evaluated as central banks seek to strike a balance between supporting economic recovery and curbing inflationary pressures. One of the primary policy responses being considered by central banks is the possibility of raising interest rates. By increasing borrowing costs, central banks aim to dampen excessive consumer spending and investment, thereby curbing inflationary pressures. However, the decision to raise interest rates is not without its implications, as it could potentially slow down economic growth and increase the cost of servicing debt for households and businesses. The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, has been closely monitoring inflation trends and signaling its intention to implement gradual interest rate hikes to address rising price pressures. While the Fed has emphasized its commitment to supporting maximum employment and sustained economic growth, policymakers are increasingly cognizant of the need to prevent inflation from spiraling out of control. Similarly, other major central banks, including the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE), are also considering tightening monetary policy in response to inflationary concerns. The ECB, which has maintained accommodative monetary policies to support the eurozone economy during the pandemic, is now facing growing calls to recalibrate its stance amid mounting inflationary pressures. In addition to potential interest rate hikes, central banks are exploring other policy options to address inflationary pressures. These include adjustments to asset purchase programs, forward guidance on future policy actions, and enhanced communication strategies to manage inflation expectations among businesses and consumers. However, policymakers are also mindful of the need to strike a delicate balance between addressing inflation concerns and supporting ongoing economic recovery efforts. Premature or overly aggressive policy tightening could risk derailing the fragile economic recovery and undermining efforts to reduce unemployment and stimulate growth. Furthermore, the effectiveness of traditional monetary policy tools in addressing supply-driven inflationary pressures remains uncertain. Structural factors such as supply chain disruptions and rising input costs may require targeted policy interventions and coordinated efforts between fiscal and monetary authorities to address underlying imbalances in the economy. In conclusion, rising inflation pressures are posing significant challenges for central banks worldwide, prompting a reassessment of policy strategies to maintain price stability and support sustainable economic growth. While interest rate hikes and other policy adjustments are being considered, policymakers must carefully calibrate their responses to strike a balance between addressing inflation concerns and supporting ongoing economic recovery efforts. Effective coordination and communication between central banks and other stakeholders will be crucial in navigating the complex economic landscape and ensuring a smooth transition to a more stable inflation environment.',

            'These are the days of Democracy. So every person is deemed to have his or her voice in the society. Hence it requires much skill as well as ability to spread good ideas amongst the literate and the illiterate, the class and the masses, the cultured and the uncultured. This task is not so easy as one thinks it to be. It requires Herculean efforts and patience. The gift of the gab, which is one of Gods choicest blessings on man is quite essential to be successful in making public speeches so a man should first try to speak well in public. This art of public speaking qualities a man to be a leader in a society, town or in any profession. Any public meeting will give him a hearty welcome. He is given the golden opportunity of speaking to the public and to impress upon the audience his own views in an efficient way. A public speaker will make or mark the destiny of a nation. A person knowing the art of speaking well in public can bring peace and happiness not only among his countrymen but also among people of all countries. One who is ignorant of this art, may only bring quarrels perchance. Public speaking is an art. We cannot done that every art will look awkward at first. Some craters are born and some are made. Some persons become experts soon while some take a pretty long time. The most powerful motor known to human being is the rocket. It is the only one that can propel space art to other planets and put satellites into orbit around the Earth. Yet it is one of the easier to understand, for even the giant space shuttle works on the same principles as the rockets you see at firework displays. The toy firework was propel invented in China over 700 years age. It has changed little since then. It is simply a tube filled with gunpowder packed very tightly. When the flame from the rocket’s burning fuse reaches the gunpowder, there is a violent chemical reaction. Different substances in the gunpowder combine and turn in to hot gases at high pressure. They try to expand, and if the tube were closed at both ends, the gases would tear it apart. But there is an opening at the lower end of the tube, and the gases rush out, forming a bright glowing trail, called the exhaust. It is the force generated by the chemical reaction that pushes out the exhaust gases. But whenever a force is exerted on something. There is a reaction an equally strong force is the opposite direction. For example, when you fire a rifle, you feel it Kick against your shoulder, the gun is pushed back by the reaction to force that drives the bullet forward. If you were standing on roller.',

            'The ongoing crisis in Myanmar has reached a critical juncture as reports of widespread human rights abuses continue to surface, drawing condemnation from the international community. The military coup on February 1, 2021, which ousted the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, has plunged the country into turmoil, leading to a wave of protests and a violent crackdown by security forces. Since seizing power, the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, has engaged in a systematic campaign of repression, targeting pro-democracy activists, journalists, and ethnic minorities. The military brutal tactics include arbitrary arrests, extrajudicial killings, torture, and sexual violence, resulting in a humanitarian crisis of grave proportions. One of the most alarming developments has been the use of lethal force against peaceful protesters. Despite calls for restraint from the international community, security forces have responded to demonstrations with live ammunition, tear gas, and rubber bullets, resulting in numerous casualties, including deaths and injuries. The targeting of unarmed civilians exercising their right to freedom of expression and assembly has sparked outrage worldwide. Furthermore, the military crackdown on media freedom has dealt a severe blow to press freedom in Myanmar. Journalists and media outlets critical of the junta have been harassed, arrested, and subjected to censorship. The closure of independent news organizations and the arrest of journalists have created a climate of fear and intimidation, severely limiting the flow of information both within the country and abroad. Ethnic minorities, particularly the Rohingya Muslim community, continue to face persecution and discrimination at the hands of the military. The Rohingya have long been marginalized in Myanmar, denied citizenship, and subjected to violence and displacement. The coup has further exacerbated their plight, with reports of military operations in Rohingya areas leading to civilian casualties and mass displacement. In response to the deteriorating situation in Myanmar, the international community has condemned the military actions in the strongest terms. The United Nations, the European Union, and individual countries have issued statements calling for the restoration of democracy, the release of political prisoners, and an end to the violence. Sanctions have been imposed on military leaders and entities associated with the junta, aimed at pressuring them to respect human rights and engage in dialogue with the opposition. Regional actors have also expressed concern about the situation in Myanmar. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), traditionally reluctant to intervene in the internal affairs of member states, has faced growing pressure to take a more proactive stance. While ASEAN has called for dialogue and a peaceful resolution to the crisis, critics argue that more decisive action is needed to address the root causes of the conflict and protect the rights of the Myanmar people. Meanwhile, civil society groups, human rights organizations, and activists around the world have rallied in solidarity with the people of Myanmar, demanding justice and accountability for the perpetrators of human rights abuses. Online campaigns, protests, and advocacy efforts have sought to raise awareness about the crisis and mobilize support for the pro-democracy movement. Despite the challenges and setbacks, the people of Myanmar remain resilient in their struggle for democracy and human rights. Civil disobedience movements, grassroots initiatives, and acts of solidarity continue to demonstrate the courage and determination of those fighting for freedom and justice. As the crisis in Myanmar unfolds, the international community faces a moral imperative to stand in solidarity with the people of Myanmar and support their aspirations for democracy, human rights, and peace. The struggle for justice in Myanmar is far from over, but with continued pressure and support, there is hope that the country can emerge from this dark chapter and build a more inclusive and democratic future for all its citizens.',

            'Thousands of clerks, typists, stenographers and special workers are now working for the government, yet the increase in the lead of government work requires; more and more workers. For appointment to government work a testing programme has been planned by the Federal Government and test centres have been set up in all parts of the country. Some branches of government service have their own sets, but the greater number of government office workers are chosen through the tests given by the Civil Services. Such tests usually include a test in speed and accuracy in typewriting a test in copying from rough draft, a general intelligence test, and a test in spelling and word usage. Under civil service testing there are various types of appointments open to those who meet the test requirements. Temporary appointment is for a short time only and rarely extends more than six months. A temporary appointment generally does not prevent consideration in regular order for probational appointment for a particular post. This temporary appointment is not offered to those who live far from the place of employment, as a practice. Probational appointment is for an indefinite period of time. The appointee is included under the system of requirement and disability benefits provided by the Civil Service Retirement Act. A good teacher normally takes decisions about his work on the basis of tradition, or recommendation of experts or experience of others or his own experience guided by common sense. Action research is a step ahead of the commonsense approach. The difference between the two is mainly of degree of refinement and discipline in the various steps for taking a decision. In action research, the teacher is deliberately more scientific and careful in diagnosing the problem, in collecting facts, in designing hypotheses in experiments with tentative practices and actions and in evaluating results of the actions taken. At every stage however, he tries to keep the experimental approach towards problem solving in close touch with reality. Action research may be individual or co-operative, when many people are concerned about a problem or when the experiment is likely to affect many people, the research could directly involve all those people. It then becomes co-operative action research. It is a well-known fact that much of the research work done by professional students of educational research is not noticed by the workers in the actual field of education. Even when some research is fully reported and is in point, not many consciously benefit by it. The advantages of action research vis-a-vis improvement in education',

            'In an era increasingly reliant on digital systems, the specter of cyber threats looms large, with recent incidents highlighting vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure worldwide. From energy grids to transportation networks, hospitals to government agencies, no sector seems immune to the ever-evolving tactics of cybercriminals. As hacking incidents targeting critical infrastructure escalate, experts warn of the potential for widespread disruption and chaos. 1) Rising Incidents: In recent months, a spate of high-profile cyberattacks has underscored the growing sophistication and audacity of malicious actors. From ransomware attacks crippling hospitals to supply chain breaches disrupting global commerce, the stakes have never been higher. However, it is the targeting of critical infrastructure that poses the gravest threat to national security and public safety. 2) Vulnerabilities Exposed: Critical infrastructure, including power plants, water treatment facilities, and transportation networks, forms the backbone of modern society. Yet, as these systems become increasingly interconnected and reliant on digital technology, they also become more susceptible to cyber threats. A successful attack on a power grid, for example, could result in widespread blackouts, economic losses, and even loss of life. 3) Recent Attacks: One of the most alarming recent incidents occurred when a cybercriminal group successfully breached the network of a major oil pipeline operator, disrupting fuel supplies to vast swathes of the East Coast. The attack, which involved ransomware, forced the company to shut down its operations temporarily, causing fuel shortages and price spikes. While the pipeline operator eventually restored operations, the incident served as a wake-up call to the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber threats. 4) Implications for National Security: The escalation of cyber threats targeting critical infrastructure has profound implications for national security. As nations become increasingly reliant on digital systems for essential services and functions, they also become more vulnerable to cyberattacks launched by state-sponsored actors or rogue hackers. The potential for cyber warfare to disrupt critical infrastructure, sow chaos, and undermine trust in government institutions is a growing concern for policymakers and security experts alike. 6) Response and Mitigation Efforts: In response to the escalating cyber threats, governments and organizations worldwide are ramping up their cybersecurity measures and investing in advanced technologies to detect, deter, and mitigate attacks. This includes deploying robust firewalls, implementing multi-factor authentication, and conducting regular cybersecurity training and drills. Additionally, increased collaborations between public and private sector entities are essential to sharing threat intelligence and coordinating responses to cyber incidents. 7) The Role of International Cooperation: Given the transnational nature of cyber threats, international cooperation is crucial in addressing cybersecurity challenges effectively. The United Nations and other international organizations have called for greater collaborations among nations to establish norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace and deter malicious actors. Diplomatic efforts to hold perpetrators of cyber-attacks accountable and impose consequences for their actions are also underway. 8) Looking Ahead: As cyber threats continue to evolve and escalate, it is clear that safeguarding critical infrastructure against cyber-attacks must be a top priority for governments, businesses, and organizations worldwide. From investing in cybersecurity defence to enhancing resilience and recovery capabilities, proactive measures are needed to mitigate the risks posed by cyber threats. Ultimately, the security and stability of our societies depend on our ability to adapt and respond effectively to the challenges of an increasingly digitized world. In conclusion, the escalation of cyber threats targeting critical infrastructure represents a significant and growing challenge for governments, businesses, and society at large. As the recent spate of hacking incidents demonstrates, the consequences of a successful cyber-attack on critical infrastructure can be severe and far-reaching. By prioritizing cybersecurity, enhancing collaboration, and investing in resilience, we can better prepare ourselves to confront the evolving cyber threats of the 21st century.',

            'The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light many social and economic disparities, and perhaps none have been more starkly exposed than those within the realm of education. As schools around the world shifted to remote learning in response to the crisis, existing educational inequities were exacerbated, leaving millions of students at a disadvantage. The need for accessible learning solutions has never been more urgent. Before the pandemic, disparities in access to quality education were already prevalent, with factors such as socioeconomic status, geographic location, and race playing significant roles. However, the sudden shift to remote learning laid bare the extent of these inequities. Many students lacked access to the necessary technology, such as computers and high-speed internet, to participate effectively in online classes. Additionally, students from low-income families faced challenges such as inadequate learning environments at home, limited parental supervision, and increased responsibilities, such as caring for siblings or contributing to household income. The impact of these inequities was felt most acutely in underserved communities, where students already faced numerous barriers to academic success. According to data from UNESCO, an estimated 1.6 billion students worldwide were affected by school closures during the height of the pandemic. For many of these students, especially those from marginalized backgrounds, the transition to remote learning meant a disruption in their education that could have long-term consequences. In the United States, the digital divide became glaringly apparent as schools struggled to provide remote learning options for all students. According to a report by Common Sense Media, approximately 15 to 16 million students in the U.S. lacked adequate internet access or devices for remote learning. This disparity disproportionately affected students of colour and those from low-income families, exacerbating existing achievement gaps and widening disparities in educational outcomes. In response to these challenges, educators, policymakers, and organizations have been working tirelessly to develop and implement accessible learning solutions. One approach has been to provide students with the necessary technology and internet access to participate in remote learning. Schools and districts have distributed laptops, tablets, and Wi-Fi hotspots to students in need, bridging the digital divide and ensuring that all students have the tools they need to succeed. Another critical aspect of addressing educational inequities is providing support and resources to students and families facing additional challenges. This includes offering mental health services, counselling, and academic support to help students navigate the challenges of remote learning. Community organizations and nonprofits have also played a crucial role in providing food assistance, childcare, and other essential services to families struggling during the pandemic. Furthermore, there has been a growing recognition of the need for innovative approaches to education that prioritize flexibility, adaptability, and inclusivity. This includes leveraging technology to create personalized learning experiences that meet the diverse needs of students, regardless of their background or circumstances. Virtual classrooms, interactive online platforms, and digital learning tools offer opportunities for students to engage with educational content in ways that are meaningful and accessible. Additionally, there has been a renewed focus on addressing systemic inequities within the education system, including disparities in funding, resources, and opportunities. Advocates and policymakers have called for investments in public education, increased support for schools serving low-income communities, and efforts to recruit and retain diverse educators who reflect the backgrounds and experiences of their students. As the world continues to grapple with the effects of the pandemic, it is clear that addressing educational inequities must be a top priority. The disparities exposed and exacerbated by the crisis highlight the urgent need for accessible learning solutions that ensure all students have the opportunity to thrive. By working together to create a more equitable and inclusive education system, we can build a brighter future for generations to come.',

While doing all these things she never expects anything in return. Her only wish is to see her child becoming successful in all fields of life. She can do anything for him or her to see this wish is fulfilled. She is always ready to work hard, no matter how many obstacles she has to face. She is never partial to her children. Her love and affection is equally distributed amongst her children. It is because of her dedication, hard work and undemanding love that makes a person successful. She is the real sources of inspiration. It was Jijabai who encouraged Shivaji Maharaj to fight against the Mughal Empire. Mahatma Gandhi learnt the values like truth and non-violence from his mother. When faced with a loss, crisis of life, changing event, we may be suddenly thrust into an unfamiliar world, one that is frightening and challenging. The first step towards coping with a loss is to accept the circumstances we are in. Non-acceptance or denial destroys peace of mind and gives rise to anger, anxiety and frustration. It may also lead to a feeling of self pity. In such a case, a person resigns himself to his fate and loses his self confidence. He is not able to cope with the reality. But a person who accepts the ups and downs of life and prepares himself to take life as a challenge gets a new strength from within to fight and succeed. The thought that there is nothing permanent in life, that highs must follow lows and lows have inevitably to be succeeded by highs can also prove to be encouraging. It can give us not only strength to face unfavourable circumstances with perseverance as well as fortitude and lead challenging and familiar world without fear and trouble as well. We find little that is romantic in the post office today; but there was a time, over a hundred years ago, when the carrying of the mails was a hazardous venture, and the mail-runner, or hirkara as he was called, had to be armed with as word or spear. That was before the railways and the air services made the delivery of the mail a routine affair. Though the first public postal service was introduced in India in 1774, the Kings and Emperors of India had always maintained their, own personal postal system. Their rule was effective partly due to their excellent means of communication, by which despatches were passed on from hand to hand either by runner or horseman. When Ibn Batuta was travelling in India in the middle of the fourteenth century he found an organised system of couriers established throughout the country. There is a foot-courier at a distance of every mile, wrote Ibn Batuta, at every three miles there is an inhabited village, and outside it three sentry boxes where the couriers sit prepared for motion with their loins girded. In the hands of each is a whip about two cubits long, and upon the head of this are small bells.',

            'As a first step towards estimating the macro-economic variables, one may assume a desired level of income to be achieved within a possible range of time. The desired level of income may be based on the goal of providing a minimum level of living for every individual. The time taken to achieve that goal will, however, depend upon the availability of domestic as well as foreign resources. Domestic savings depends upon the propensity to save while foreign resources depend upon the loans and aids from foreign countries. The propensity to save depends upon the saving tendencies of the private, corporate and public sectors. The domestic savings may tend to increase depending upon the Governments policy of promoting and attracting different savings schemes. In the same way, Government can also encourage a higher rate of savings in the corporate sector by allowing different types of tax rebates. Governments effort may also be directed towards the increase in their own saving by reducing uneconomic expenditure on current account and by taking measures of increasing taxes. However, any measures of increasing taxes should be so choosen that it increases the overall savings of the there broad groups. Another important measure of supplementing saving may be to deficit financing. The level of the deficit financing should be limited. The relationship between a child and his mother is imperishable.

            'In recent years, a remarkable shift towards renewable energy sources has been observed across the globe, particularly in developing countries. This transition is not only driven by environmental concerns but also by the economic benefits associated with renewable energy projects. Developing nations are increasingly recognizing the potential of renewable energy to stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and enhance energy security. 1) The Rise of Renewable Energy in Developing Countries: Renewable energy, including solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power, has emerged as a viable alternative to fossil fuels in many developing countries. These nations are harnessing their abundant natural resources to develop clean energy infrastructure and reduce dependence on imported fuels. Governments are implementing policies and incentives to attract investment in renewable energy projects, leading to a surge in installations and capacity expansion.2) Economic Benefits Unleashed: The transition to renewable energy is proving to be a catalyst for economic development in developing countries, with a multitude of benefits: 1) Job Creation: Renewable energy projects have become significant sources of employment in developing nations. The construction, operation, and maintenance of solar and wind farms, as well as the manufacturing of related equipment, provide job opportunities for local communities. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the renewable energy sector employed over 11 million people globally in 2018, with developing countries accounting for a substantial portion of these jobs. 2) Investment Opportunities: The renewable energy sector presents lucrative investment opportunities for both domestic and foreign investors. Developing countries are attracting billions of dollars in investment for renewable energy projects, including infrastructure development, technology deployment, and capacity building. This influx of capital stimulates economic activity, fosters innovation, and drives sustainable growth in the long term. 3) Energy Access and Affordability: For many developing nations, renewable energy offers a cost-effective solution to energy poverty and access challenges. By investing in decentralized renewable energy systems, such as off-grid solar power and microgrids, countries can extend electricity access to remote and underserved communities. This not only improves quality of life but also enhances economic opportunities, education, and healthcare services. 4) Energy Security and Resilience: Diversifying the energy mix with renewable sources enhances energy security and resilience in developing countries. Unlike fossil fuels, which are subject to price volatility and geopolitical risks, renewable energy resources are abundant and domestically available. By reducing reliance on imported fuels, countries can mitigate the impact of external shocks and ensure a more stable energy supply for their citizens and industries. 5) Environmental Sustainability: Beyond economic considerations, renewable energy contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. Developing countries, which often bear the brunt of climate-related disasters and environmental degradation, stand to benefit immensely from transitioning to clean energy sources. By embracing renewable energy, these nations can achieve their sustainable development goals while safeguarding the planet for future generations. 6) Case Studies: Success Stories from Around the Globe Numerous developing countries have demonstrated the transformative power of renewable energy in driving economic growth. For instance, Morocco has made significant investments in solar and wind energy, positioning itself as a regional leader in renewable energy deployment. The country ambitious renewable energy targets have attracted substantial investment, created jobs, and reduced dependency on fossil fuels. Similarly, Kenya has emerged as a renewable energy hub in East Africa, with notable advancements in geothermal and wind power generation. The country focus on renewable energy has not only expanded access to electricity but also spurred economic development in rural areas through productive use initiatives and job creation. Conclusion: Renewable energy projects are reshaping the economic landscape of developing countries, offering a path toward sustainable development, energy independence, and prosperity. As the world transitions towards a low-carbon future, the economic benefits of renewable energy will continue to drive investment, innovation, and inclusive growth in nations striving to unlock their clean energy potential. By harnessing the power of renewable resources, developing countries can build resilient economies that benefit both present and future generations.',

            'Man is capable of harnessing energy from various sources, like windmill, wood, coal and peat, atom and sun. Amongst these wind is the oldest source of energy in the world. Ships and yachts were moved by wind the help of sails, before engines were introduced to run them. Man used the wind for movement from one place to another. It was also the first source of energy, apart from horses and bullocks, to draw water from the well, to grind wheat, etc. Wind mills were common in many countries, especially in Holland. They are still functioning and are a great attraction for tourists. Wood replaced wind as a source of energy, as it was available in abundance throughout the world, and also because it could be used anywhere unlike wind that was available only where it was swift and constant. Wood was burnt, and the heat was used to turn water into steam that became a very useful form of energy. This source of energy was used for a very long time in engines, steamers, machines, etc. till coal was discovered as a source of energy. Coal substituted wood for providing energy. It had an advantage over wood as it was higher and occupied less space for storage, and also gave more heat. Known as Black Gold, it was used in ships, mills, locomotives and used to generate electricity in thermal power stations. The work which has been going on regarding the minds of men suggests that one fifth of a second is about a limit for most of us in the matter of the useful division of time in our minds. But one fifth of a second. Short as it may seem, is a very long time indeed when it is considered in relation to a piece of time measuring only a thousandth millionth of a second. It is those same heavy going minds of men that have made the machines which are so quick, and it is men who have to tell the machines what to do. Without men to help them the machines can do nothing and are quite worthless. All the many and wonderful manufacture things in the world today come from the minds of the men. They do not make themselves; and it is very strange indeed to that men can manufacture machines which then do in work and carry out certain action better than himself. Man is a thinking being, and he has always directing much of his thought towards making things which would save him from hard labour.',

            'Dowry practice in India is a curse that has spread its poisonous tentacles to all corners of the country. It has not spared any caste or community. It is a shame that it is so prevalent in a society that has such a rich traditional culture. Dowry system has been in India since the ancient days. Girls and boys were married while they were hardly in their teens. The parents sent their daughter to her new home with lots of gifts and basic necessities that would sustain her and her husband till such time as the husband was old enough to start earning. This age-old tradition continues today, but now it is greed - that of the grooms folks - which has made it a social evil. In this modern age, where girls are given equal opportunities for higher education and better jobs, parents are wary of giving away their daughters in marriage to someone who is lesser qualified than them. On the other hand, if the boy has a high social standing and status in Society, and has a very lucrative job, then there is increasing demands made by his parents in the form of dowry. Many families cannot afford to meet these demands, and find their daughters left high and dry on the shelf. Late marriages, deaths and suicide, and bride-burning are a few commonplace occurrences, especially in rural areas of Northern India. India is one of the developing nations in the Worlds. Through rich in resources, considerable percentage of population live below the poverty line. Why are our people so poor ? Why are thousands of people starving and homeless ? Why is there poverty in the midst of plenty ? Why are we not progressing, as other countries are ? One of the important reasons for this is corruption. Corruption is responsible for this tragic state of affairs in our country. Everyone wants to become rich and lead a luxurious life as quickly as possible. In the mad rush for riches, qualities like honesty, sincerity and efficiency are sacrificed. Unfortunately, Indians, as a nation, are not concerned about the good of society. We fail to realize that if society benefits, we too will benefit. Hence, instead of complaining against and objecting to malpractices, we prefer the easy way out. We bribe people and grease their palms to get our work done knowing fully well that this is wrong to do so.',

            'Fashion means to make things in life in such a way as are subject to change in form and style according to the prevailing traditions. Fashions may be in dress, ornaments, hair style, customs, in food, drink, in amusements or in manners. Fashions change like wind which makes it difficult for man to keep pace with them. Fashion is found both among men and women. There is much craze for fashions among boys and girls. They watch TV programmes, see films and copy their style of talking, dress and walking style. They love dresses of the latest cuts and designs. They run after the new show and eye-catching dresses. Girls move freely in new fashions like butterflies. Boys too copy the film actors in their actions, stumes, hair style and even in waking. They keep long hair like girls. On the other hand, girls like boycut hairs and look boyish. Boys and Girls have made it a fashion to talk about cricket matches and films. It is the fashion for them to drive two matches at the high speed. They have also made it fashion to talk to their parents in English style instead of respecting them like Indians. They have made it fashion to run down their elders. There is no harm in changing fashions but excess of everything is bad. The craze for fashion must not go too far, should be in a limit. Secondary Market is a market where securities are traded. It is a place which provides liquidity to the securities issued in the Primary Market. The secondary market is represented by the stock exchange which provides an organised market place for investors to buy and sell securities. In other words, trading of securities subsequent to its primary offering takes place in secondary market. The secondary market induce investors to continuously rearrange their investments if they wish so. The initial buyer in the Primary Market may re-offer his securities to any interested buyer at mutually acceptable price. The stock exchange provides a market place where such mutually acceptable price may be determined. This active role of Secondary Market promoters growth of the Primary Market and encourages capital formation because investors in the primary market are assured of continuous and ready market for their investment. They can liquidate their securities in the stock exchange at any time.',

            'There is a time and place for everything. You must know the true value of time; snatch, seize and enjoy every moment of it. No idleness, no laziness, no procrastination. Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today. If work is done in time, it saves a lot of labour later on. For example, you notice that the button on your shirt is hanging loose. It would be better to sew it on tightly before you lose the button altogether. This applies to studies also. If you keep studying daily and not putting it off to a later date, examination time would not be one of tension and worry. Otherwise your mind will not be able to cope up with all the last minute cramming and learning. Everything will seem to be new and Creek to you then. Do not procrastinate and defer discussions to a later time. Do it now. The present is the time for action. If you have to send a reply to a letter, why postpone doing it when a later date would not have the same impact that an immediate response has ? Making excuses later on may not be the solution to patch up hurt feelings. As far as friendship is concerned, the right act at the opportune time binds friendships. If you need to apologies to someone, do it at once so that no ill feelings linger. Where health is concerned, never neglect medication. Dhira was a shoeshine boy. He lost his father when he was very young and now lived in a jhuggi with his mother and sister. Dhira was a hard working boy. After school, he would sit near a cinema hall and polish shoes for a living. One day it was very bot. Dhira sat under a tree counting his day’s earnings and humming a popular tune when he overhead a passerby. A thief has just escaped from the jewellery shop. Dhira stopped counting. He quickly put his money back in his pocket and asked the passerby. When ? Where ? Just on. He stole a gold necklace and managed to run away. They say he has a beard.

            'In an era where information flows freely, the role of journalists as guardians of truth and accountability is more crucial than ever. However, recent trends signal a troubling escalation in threats to press freedom and the safety of journalists worldwide. From physical attacks to legal harassment and online intimidation, journalists face an increasingly hostile environment that undermines their ability to report without fear or bias. 1)Rising Incidents of Violence and Intimidation The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reports a disturbing rise in attacks targeting journalists globally. From authoritarian regimes to democratic societies, journalists are facing threats to their safety in various forms. Physical assaults, kidnappings, and even assassinations have become all too common, particularly in regions plagued by conflict or political unrest. In countries like Mexico, where organized crime and corruption thrive, journalists risk their lives to expose wrongdoing. According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Mexico ranks among the deadliest countries for journalists, with at least ten journalists killed in 2023 alone. Many more face threats, harassment, and attacks for their investigative reporting on sensitive issues. Similarly, in countries like Russia and Belarus, journalists critical of the government are routinely harassed, detained, and silenced. The recent arrest of Russian investigative journalist Ivan Golunov on fabricated drug charges sparked international outrage and renewed concerns about press freedom in the country. Despite Golunov release following public outcry, his case underscores the dangers faced by journalists who dare to challenge the status quo. 2) Online Threats and Digital Surveillance: In addition to physical violence, journalists also face significant threats in the digital realm. Online harassment, cyberattacks, and surveillance pose serious risks to journalist safety and freedom of expression. Social media platforms once heralded as tools for democratizing information, have become battlegrounds for disinformation campaigns and targeted attacks on journalists. According to the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), online harassment of journalists has reached epidemic proportions, with female journalists disproportionately targeted by abusive and threatening messages. The anonymity afforded by the internet emboldens attackers, who use tactics ranging from doxing to death threats to silence journalists and undermine their credibility. Moreover, governments and authoritarian regimes increasingly rely on sophisticated surveillance technologies to monitor and intimidate journalists. The use of spyware and hacking tools to infiltrate journalist devices poses grave risks to their safety and the confidentiality of their sources. Journalists operating in authoritarian regimes or conflict zones must navigate a digital minefield where their every move is scrutinized and their communications are vulnerable to interception. 3) Challenges to Press Freedom in Democracies Even in democracies with robust legal protections for press freedom, journalists are not immune to threats and harassment. The rise of populist movements and the erosion of trust in traditional media have furled hostility towards journalists and emboldened attacks on press freedom. In the United States, journalists face unprecedented challenges, including verbal attacks from political leaders, lawsuits aimed at silencing critical reporting, and physical assaults during protests and rallies. The Capitol insurrection of January 6, 2021, highlighted the dangers faced by journalists covering political unrest, as reporters were threatened and assaulted while documenting the chaos. 4) Call to Action: The growing threats to press freedom and journalist safety demand urgent attention and concerted action from governments, civil society, and the international community. Protecting journalists is not only a matter of upholding human rights and democracy but also essential for safeguarding the public right to access accurate and independent information. Efforts to address these challenges must include robust legal protections for journalists, accountability for perpetrators of violence and harassment, and support for independent media organizations. Journalists must be able to work freely and without fear of reprisal, whether they are reporting from conflict zones, exposing corruption, or holding those in power accountable. As threats to press freedom continue to evolve and proliferate, it is incumbent upon all stakeholders to defend the vital role of journalism in promoting transparency, accountability, and democracy. The stakes are high, and the time to act is now. 360 Global Efforts to Address Plastic Waste Pollution Gain Momentum with New Initiatives Plastic waste pollution has become a pressing environmental issue, with devastating impacts on ecosystems, marine life, and human health. However, amidst growing awareness and concern, global efforts to tackle this crisis are gaining momentum through innovative initiatives and collaborative actions. In recent years, the proliferation of single-use plastics has contributed significantly to the accumulation of plastic waste in landfills, oceans, and other natural habitats. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), approximately 8 million tons of plastic enter the oceans every year, posing a serious threat to marine biodiversity and ecosystems. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), businesses, and individuals are coming together to address plastic pollution through a variety of initiatives and strategies. One notable development is the increasing adoption of plastic bags and restrictions by governments around the world. Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Kenya have implemented regulations aimed at reducing the consumption of single-use plastics, including bans on plastic bags, straws, and other disposable items. These measures are designed to encourage the use of sustainable alternatives and reduce the production of plastic waste. In addition to regulatory approaches, there is a growing emphasis on waste management and recycling initiatives. Many countries are investing in infrastructure and technologies to improve recycling rates and reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills or the environment. Advanced recycling technologies, such as chemical recycling and pyrolysis, are being developed to convert plastic waste into valuable resources, such as fuel or new plastic products. Furthermore, public awareness campaigns and education programs play a crucial role in changing attitudes and behaviour towards plastic consumption and disposal. NGOs and environmental groups are leading efforts to raise awareness about the impacts of plastic pollution and promote sustainable alternatives. These campaigns aim to empower individuals to make informed choices and take action to reduce their plastic footprint. At the corporate level, many businesses are committing to sustainability goals and implementing measures to reduce their reliance on single-use plastics. Major companies across various industries are phasing out plastic packaging, introducing recyclable or compostable alternatives, and implementing strategies to improve the circularity of their products. Corporate initiatives such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation New Plastics Economy Global Commitment bring together businesses, governments, and NGOs to accelerate the transition to a circular economy for plastics. International cooperation and collaboration are also essential components of the global effort to address plastic pollution. Initiatives such as the UN Environment Assembly resolution on marine litter and microplastics and the G7 Ocean Plastics Charter bring together governments from around the world to coordinate action and share best practices for reducing plastic waste. Multilateral agreements, such as the Basel Convention amendments on plastic waste, aim to regulate the transboundary movement of plastic waste and prevent its illegal disposal or dumping in developing countries. Despite these efforts, challenges remain in addressing plastic waste pollution comprehensively. The scale of the problem requires sustained commitment and cooperation at all levels, from local communities to international organizations. Additionally, addressing plastic pollution requires a multifaceted approach that considers the entire lifecycle of plastic products, from production to disposal. In conclusion, the global momentum to address plastic waste pollution is growing, driven by a recognition of the urgent need for action and the potential for innovative solutions. With continued collaboration and collective effort, there is hope for a future where plastic pollution is effectively managed, and the health of the planet is safeguarded for generations to come',

            'In a country like India, where the population is very high and most of the people are poor, the bus is the cheapest form of transportation for long distances. Unfortunately, there are not enough buses to transport the masses from one destination to another. Hence, the buses are always overcrowded. In a big city where distances are great, buses are normally overcrowded. You find children using the bus to travel to school and colleges, men and women going to offices or shopping, patients going to hospitals, and so on. They are all jostling for a foothold in the bus. You find long queues at bus-stands, but when the bus arrives, everyone is rushing to get in, and the queue disappears. I had harrowing experience the other day. It was hot summer day in the morning. I was waiting at the bus-stop to board the bus that would transport me to the spot where I was attending an interview for a job. I gave myself enough time to reach the place well in time to attend the interview, and some to spare. After a wait of ten minutes I saw the bus approaching. I checked to see that I had the exact change to pay for my fare, and clutched by handbag tightly to my chest. The bus stopped right in front of me with three others ahead of me. I waited for them to get in first as we were in a queue. True success is measured by the feeling of knowing we have done a job well and have achieved our objective. Success is not measured by our position in life but by the obstacles we overcame to get there. Success in life is not determined by how we are doing compared with others, but by how we are doing compared with what we are capable of doing. Successful people compete against themselves. They better their own record and keep improving constantly. Success is not measured by how high we go up in life, but rather by how many times we bounce back when we fall down. It is this bounce back ability that determine success. Most people give up just when they are about to achieve success. They quit on the one yard line. They give up at the last minute of the game. One foot from a winning touchdown. Successful people do not do great things, they only do small things in a great way. Success and happiness go hand in hand. Success is getting what you want and happiness is wanting what you get.',

            'Walking is the safest and most convenient activity for weight control, ailment-free, healthy and all round physical fitness. But walking also gives one a lot of pleasure and satisfaction. Walking is about success, growth, determination and deduction. Did you know that walking uses large portions of muscle groups in your legs and arms in a steady, rhythmic pattern ? No wonder it is recommended for not just fitness but for total health too. It is the cornerstone of a total approach to personal fitness. Walking is one exercise that offers multiple advantages at a minimum cost and with least effort. Walking increases the flow of oxygen to all tissues and cells. It increases the high density lipoproteins which protects the heart and blood vessels from fatty deposits. It protects and strengthens the heart muscles whereby it can pump more blood with fewer beats. Walking increases the ability of the body to handle stress successfully, making you less prone to blood pressure and heart disease. It decreases the sugar fats, known as triglycerides, thus preventing their being deposited on the lining of the arteries. Walking also increases the efficient functioning of exercising muscles and blood circulation, so that muscles and blood can process oxygen more easily which has utmost importance. I was the last child of a small-town government servant, in a family of five brothers. My earliest memory of my father is as that of a district employment officer in Koraput, Orissa. It was and remains as back of beyond as you can imagine. There was no electricity; no primary school nearby and water did not flow out of a tap. As a result, I did not go to school until the age of eight; I was home-schooled. My father used to get transferred every year. The family belongings fit into the back of a jeep, so the family moved from place to place; without any trouble, my mother would set up an establishment and get us going. Raised by a widow who had come as a refugee from the then East Bengal, she was a matriculate when she married my father. My parents set the foundation of my life and the value system which makes me what I am today and largely defines what success means to me. As district employment officer, my father was given a jeep by the government.',

Shows great happiness if he succeeded in reading new words, shows interest in reading name plates of shops and number plates of vehicles while walking on roads. Span of attention is limited. Attention is disturbed easily. As there is development in various skills, childhood wants to do everything ourselves. Express honour and respect for his teacher.

A public teacher, he travelled from one place to another wearing his food pan upturned on his head and carrying his trademark broom. When he entered on village, he would instantly start cleaning the gutters and roads of the village. He also told the citizens of the village that their congratulations would have to wait until his work was done. Villagers gave him money. Babaji used that for progress of physical as well as thinking of society. From the obtained money, Maharaj built educational institutions, dharmashalas, hospitals and animal shelters. He conducted his discourses in the form of Kirtans in which he would emphasize values like service to humanity and compassion. During his Kirtans, he would educate people against blind faiths and rituals. He would use Dohas by Kabir in his discourses.',

            'Reading is a pleasure, reading is an education, reading is an art. Reading is an art because if we are to get pleasure from it and if we are to find it is a useful education, it is necessary that we should learn what to read and when to read it. There are men who are always reading. It does not matter where they find themselves or with when they are in company; they reach for the nearest thing with words in it and read it. They do not seem to read for pleasure or for knowledge but merely in order to read. They read advertisements of things they will never buy, and they even read time-table for trains they will never use. They read because it is less trouble to read than it is to speak. There are others who are not quite so careless about what they read and who do indeed read for pleasure, but they limit themselves to one kind of book and probably to a daily picture newspaper. If they are young girl’s they perhaps read only paper booked stories; if they are young men they perhaps read only stories of law-breakers. There are others, happily, who are wiser and who value more highly the great art of reading. Writing and reading must be considered the meet wonderful arts of mankind. When men learned to speak they showed themselves to be on a different plane from all other living things. Man is a beautiful creation of Nature. Dhira was a shoeshine boy.

            'Farmers in India, in ancient times, were illiterate and were cheated out of their land, and exploited, suffering injustice. Unscrupulous landlords deprived them of their rights, moneylenders and middlemen got their thumb impressions on false documents of possession. With the spread of adult education, bonded labour, economic slavery, superstitious beliefs are on the wane. The problem with adult education though is that these adults have to earn their bread too. They can be taught only during their spare time near their houses. Nongovernment organisations can achieve this. Being illiterate they need to be educated about family planning too, as they usually have large families in the false belief that the more children they have the more income they will have with all their children earning. As the adults form forty per cent of the population, most of them living in villages, they are uneducated, hence, all the more need for adult education. In cities the uneducated constitute the slum dwellers, pavement hawkers and coolies at railway platforms. These are mostly engaged in manual work. So what kind of education do they need ? Not anything technical like history, science or economics. The simple 3Rules would be enough to get them going. They should be given knowledge about their country. A business organization cannot function without Capital. A joint stock company which is modern form of business organization, cannot start, carry on and expand its activities unless it can raise capital. A company needs capital to purchase land, construct building, buy plant and machinery, raw materials, employ people, market its products, pay transport and warehousing charges etc. Thus, like any business organization a company requires capital for various purposes. A company is in need of capital on different occasions. At company promotion stage it requires capital for bringing a body corporate into existence. Once it comes into reality it begins to run its business. At this stage it needs capital to carry on its every day business. At the later stage when it plans for expansion it also searches for more and more capital. So right from its commencement till its future growth, a company needs capital. In case of a small scale company its capital needs may be limited',

            'Student unrest is one of problems of the day. The problem, however, cannot be analysed properly unless we view it in the larger context of general unrest and discontentment in the country. As the things are, there is growing dissatisfaction everywhere. Prices are soaring and the burden of taxation is growing heavier. Corruption is ramphant everywhere. Academic institutions are no exception to it. These have polluted the students mind and created unrest in their hearts. Growing frustration is the root cause of students unrest. An average has nothing but frustration is store for him, especially in the matter of employment. He does not see any scope for a secure future for him. He joins one or the other course of study without any definite aim of his life. So he is frustrated. Political exploitation is another cause for student unrest. The vested interests in all political parties try to use the force of students for their personal ends. They patronise the student leaders in times of their union elections and ultimately use them for their personal needs through their agents and pollute academic atmosphere. They often instigate the students to indulge in anti-social and subversive activities. The uncertainty of future caused by international conflicts, aimless wars and mounting unemployment. Life is not just party and pleasure; it is also pain and despair, Unthinkable things happen. Sometimes everything turns upside down. Bad things happen to good people. Some things are beyond control. Such as physical disability and birth defects. We cannot choose our parents or the circumstances of our birth. If the ball bounced the wrong way for you, will you cry or take the ball and run ? That is a choice you have to make. You can see there are hundreds of boats sailing in all different directions in a lake. Even though the wind is blowing in one direction, the sailboats are going the different directions. It depends on the way the sail is set. And that is determined by the sailor. The same is true of our lives. We cannot choose the direction of the wind, but we can choose how we set our sail. Health, happiness and success depends upon the fighting spirit of each person. The big thing is that what we do about what happens to us. We can choose our attitude.',

            'The rate of population growth is larger in India as compared with other countries. Hence population is the basic reason behind financial, social, political and environmental problems in India. To inculcate the concept of one family one child, to create awareness among the women, women education is necessary. When half part of population remains inactive, dependent then it is loss of society and obviously of nation. Hence women must be empowered and should be given opportunity to prove herself in each and every field of life. She should be active in politics, sociality, research, administration, education etc. and for this purpose women education is most important thing. Culture is a characteristic of human life. It is necessary to accept new ideas by eliminating outdated traditions when transfer of culture takes place from one generation to next. The role of women in this process is almost crucial. Women education is essential because women have capacity to make change through education. The progress of a nation is dependent on the quality of its human resources. Human resources increase as production of intellectuals, artists, good administrators, doctors, engineers, researchers increases. Woman education is very essential and important for cultural development in India. The rate of population growth is larger in India as compared with other countries. Hence population is the basic reason behind financial, social, political and environmental problems in India. To inculcate the concept of one family one child, to create awareness among the women, women education is necessary. When half part of population remains inactive, dependent then it is loss of society and obviously of nation. Hence women must be empowered and should be given opportunity to prove herself in each and every field of life. She should be active in politics, sociality, research, administration, education etc. and for this purpose women education is most important thing. Culture is a characteristic of human life. It is necessary to accept new ideas by eliminating outdated traditions when transfer of culture takes place from one generation to next. The role of women in this process is almost crucial.

            'A country which has the craze for self rule and in which all the communities consider itself as one is called a nation. Economic independence, culture, language and territorial integration are the ties of a nation. There is a feeling of oneness, unity and commonness in it. India is a country where National Integration is heard most. There has been political disunity, and rise and fall of various empires. Different languages are spoken here. People have different food habits. Different religious are propagated here. But Indian culture and customs has united the Indians and promoted a feeling of oneness and common citizenship. National Integration is a psychological process. It means a well knit society in which all are loyal to their country. It means that every Indian irrespective of caste, creed, language or religion belongs to India and is proud of his country. National Integration is very important for the all-round development of the country. In fact, its existence depends on it. There are different climates in India. Food habits are different, crops are different and there is a difference in faiths and beliefs. They wear different dresses. Even the Indian customs and conventions are cast and varied. The people pursue different sects and religions. There is difference in lands. The pattern of energy consumption in rural areas is important in any understanding of rural energy developments. With this end in view, let us examine the type of energy usage that takes place in the rural areas. Human Society acts on nature to produce either food or goods which are then consumed. Unlike animals, human beings not only acquire but also transform natural produce. Any such transformation requires energy as a necessary input. Energy and production always go hand in hand. Higher the level of production, higher generally is the level of energy utilisation. In this context, electricity, oil and coal are the common commercial energy sources which are being used in rural areas. Rural electrification was set as an important social goal in the India planning process. It was felt that the impact of electrification should not be considered in terms of narrow economic cost benefits but looked upon as an investment in terms of modernisation for the rural areas.',

In the national perspective, transport planning process, in which transport is linked with other sector economy, and the choice and capacities of each mode of transport should be decided after giving due consideration to requirements of various sectors, costs, energy efficiency and other factors. Government of India has clearly emphasised energy conservation as the most important objective in National Transport Policy. Road Transport is a vital sector of Nation economy, and it claims a good share of the energy consumed. Out of villages are yet to be provided with all-weather motorised routes. There will be minimum 10 per cent growth in energy consumption in the road transport conservation in Road Transport Section. Crores of rupees were spent in building roads to maintain them in good conditions. These are characteristic clouds which are indicators of thunderstorm. These look like huge mountains. These are dense and dark in colour. There is thunder accompanied by lightening. They bring rain with storm and may sometime bring hailstones. But such a type of rain does not last long. The largest of these clouds bring rainfall accompanied with lightning. The top portion of these clouds has an anvil like shape. The clouds have a positive charge at the upper and negative charge at the lower end. The land below them always has negative charge. Due to difference in the charges, electric chargers are formed and lighting occur lighting up the sky for a moment. The air around the lighting rises up because of the heat and this leads to a large thundering sound. As compared to other clouds, the rain drops of these clouds are larger because they move up and down a lot of times and accumulate more and more water. Drops become larger and larger and are unable to float in the clouds because of their weight. They fall in the form of rain. Sometimes, the air in the clouds is very cold. As a result, these drops freeze and fall in the form of hail. We call them hailstones. Raindrops coming towards the earth are stopped in the clouds itself because of strong vertical winds which change into hail.',

            'In a historic achievement, NASAs Perseverance rover has successfully landed on Mars, marking a major milestone in humanity exploration of the Red Planet. The culmination of years of planning, engineering, and anticipation, the landing represents a triumph of scientific innovation and perseverance. The Perseverance rover, a state-of-the-art robotic explorer, embarked on its journey to Mars atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on July 30, 2020, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. After a journey of nearly seven months covering over 300 million miles (470 million kilometres), the rover entered the Martian atmosphere on February 18, 2021, in a complex and meticulously choreographed landing sequence known as the Seven Minutes of Terror. The landing process, fraught with challenges and uncertainties, required precise execution to ensure the rovers safe arrival on the Martian surface. As the spacecraft descended through the thin Martian atmosphere, it deployed a parachute to slow its descent before firing retrorockets to further decelerate. In the final phase, the rover was gently lowered to the surface by a sky crane, which then detached and flew away to avoid any potential collision with the rover. The tense moments during the landing were met with jubilation and relief as mission control at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, received confirmation of the successful touchdown. Cheers erupted among the team members, who had devoted years of their lives to designing, building, and preparing the rover for its mission on Mars. The primary objective of the Perseverance mission is to search for signs of ancient microbial life and collect samples of Martian rock and soil for future return to Earth. Equipped with advanced scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and a drill capable of collecting core samples, the rover will explore Jezioro Crater, a 28-mile-wide (45-kilometer-wide) basin believed to have once contained a lake billions of years ago. One of the key instruments aboard Perseverance is the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE), which aims to demonstrate the production of oxygen from the Martian atmosphere. This technology could pave the way for future human exploration of Mars by enabling astronauts to produce oxygen for breathing and use as rocket propellant. In addition to its scientific objectives, Perseverance is also carrying out several innovative technologies and experiments, including the Ingenuity helicopter, a small robotic helicopter designed to demonstrate powered flight in the thin Martian atmosphere. If successful, Ingenuity could open up new possibilities for aerial exploration of Mars and other planetary bodies. The successful landing of Perseverance comes on the heels of previous NASA missions to Mars, including the Curiosity rover, which has been exploring the Martian surface since 2012. Each mission builds upon the knowledge and experience gained from previous endeavours, advancing our understanding of the Red Planet and preparing the groundwork for future human missions. The international scientific community has hailed the achievement as a testament to human ingenuity and collaboration, with researchers around the world eagerly anticipating the wealth of data and insights that Perseverance will provide. From unravelling the mysteries of Mars geological history to unlocking the potential for future human exploration, the mission holds promise for expanding our understanding of the cosmos and our place within it. As Perseverance begins its mission on Mars, it carries with it the hopes and aspirations of countless scientists, engineers, and space enthusiasts who have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of knowledge and exploration. With its arrival on the Martian surface, the rover embarks on a new chapter in humanity quest to unlock the secrets of the cosmos and push the boundaries of what is possible.',

            'The most powerful mother known to human beings is the rocket. It is the only one that can propel space craft to other planets and put satellites into orbit around the earth. Yet it is one of the easiest to understand, for even the giant space shuttle works on the same principles as the rockets you see at firework displays. The toy firework was probably invented in China over 700 years ago. It has changed little since then. It is simply a tube filled with gunpowder packed very tightly. When the flame from the rockets burning fuse reaches the gunpowder, there is a violent chemical reaction. Different substances in the gunpowder combine and turn into hot gases at high pressure. They try to expand, and if the tube were closed at both ends, the gases would tear it apart. But there is an opening at the lower end of the tube, and the gases rush out, forming a bright glowing trail, called the exhaust. It is the force generated by chemical reaction that pushes out the exhaust gases. But wherever a force is exerted on something, there is a reaction an equally strong force in the opposite direction. For example, when you fire a refile, you feel it kick against your shoulder. The gun is pushed back by the reaction to the force that drives the bullet forward. If you were standing on roller skates while carrying a heavy bag, and you were unwise enough to throw the bag away from you, you would find yourself rolling away in the opposite direction. The reaction to your throwing the bag would have given you an equal and opposite push. In the same way, the explosion of the gunpowder in the rocket tube not only pushes out the exhaust gases. As we have seen, national income of India is low but what is even more distressing is that the National Income is unevenly distributed. Inequalities of income are a common feature of all economics. But the degree of inequality of incomes to be found in India is especially falling. A very small section of a society possesses and enjoys a relatively larger share of national income and wealth compared to others in the nation it shows inequality in the distribution of income and wealth in the country. This inequality in the personal distribution is important to study the problem of poverty in India. It also indicates how different sections of the society share the national income and wealth and how distribution pattern of income has changed over the period. It seems that the large number of people claimed minimum income and small number of people received maximum income. Many studies revealed that there existed a high degree of inequality in the distribution of income, assets and concentration of economic power in few hands. Inequalities of income and wealth lead to some various serious economic, social and political consequences. Hence the government has to undertake remedial measures to eradicate poverty and to reduce inequalities in income and wealth. The Government of India has adopted economic planning since 1951 to achieve certain aims and objectives and thereby to achieve rapid economic development. Basically, there are two important objectives of planning in India namely improving standard of living of the masses and establishment of socialistic pattern of society. In 1975, the problem of poverty was heavily focussed',

            'The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. This proverbial statement emphasises the role of a mother in the building or a nation. This role is indisputable indeed. A mother is the best nurse, guide and guardian that a child can have. It is for her to make a saint of him of a dacoit. It is for her to cultivate in him undaunted courage of object cowardice. The formative years of a mans life are spent in the lap of his mother. Whatever stamp of mould his impressionable day gets from his mother becomes his permanent mark, Shivaji, the great Indian warrior, learnt the fundamental lessons of warfare from his mother, who also inspired him with the legends of the great heroes of the old. Almost all the great men of the world will gratefully acknowledge the influence of their mother in their early development, although, women having a self-effacing nature, this influence may not be recorded anywhere.

At the same time, you can serve the purpose of another and serve it even better. You can still have the pay and yet be working out your own purpose. Remember that all good purposes tend in the same direction and go hand in hand. Decide now that you will have a purpose, then your life will be the richer. Your eyes will soon, begin reading all the copy you are typing by phrases or world groups. The words combine into a short chain. Every time your eyes see that chain of words, you set up a chain of acts that enable you to reproduce the word group. So, there should be a purpose in our life. I had seen her at a road crossing for years. Wherever I had stopped at the red light she came bearing one child in her arms another following her, tugging at her dirty and torn-at-places dhoti. She always had a bundle of newspapers in her arm and would tap at the closed windows of air-conditioned cars and ask the occupants to buy one. If she found an open window, she would drop a copy and wait a while, then, without uttering a word go to another open window and repeat the trick. Most often it worked and some called her and gave her a coin or two, much higher than the price of the paper, and some, in their hurry as the traffic lights would give the go signal, would throw the coins or notes towards her and speed away. But there were some who would close their windows at her approach and other sit quietly or turn their faces the other way. She seemed a very satisfied women and even if people rebuked her on occasions, she would ignore it and continue to sell her papers without a second thought to the scolding. Often, I saw this woman sitting on the grass or dust of the road eating a meal and feeding her son with home-made bread. Sometimes with lentil or otherwise just plain chapatis. I used to wonder why this woman, who must be earning quite well, was so indifferent towards her food. One day it so happened that my car stopped all of a sudden and I let it run along the side to avoid getting in the way of traffic. I opened the hood of the car to see if it was something very minor which I could deal with. I tinkered with the battery terminals, checked the pipe going to the carburettor, meddled with the cut-outs start',

            'In a small business concern goods received may well be unpacked by the owner and invoice, or packing note, checked at the same time. He may also check the goods against the order to ensure that they are as ordered both as to type and quantity. If the business is large enough for this work to be entrusted to others, it is the responsibility of the owner to control it by making checks from time to time. No question of fraud is being considered here, control in this case being to ensure that goods received are those required. The system of checking will change with the number of staff available. The work to be done is to check goods against the order goods against invoice, pricing of Invoice and then checking them into store. Some method will have to be followed to ensure that these checks are carried out with all goods arriving. If it is possible to entrust the work, so that a different person is in charge of each section that will help the owner of the business but this is not always possible. The Planning Commission has reportedly set up a twelve-member national committee on tourism. The task entrusted to it is to tell the commission whether tourism ought to be encouraged and if so, how to go about it. Had this been Nineteen Fifty-Six instead of Nineteen Eighty-Six, one might have felt enthused by the idea of such a committee. Thirty years ago, tourism was scarcely recognised as an industry worth promoting. There is also no longer any mystery about how to promote tourism, and there are examples galore of country which have achieved singular success in attracting the foreign holiday maker. It is, therefore, difficult to see just what the national committee is going to say that has not been said already time and again. Basically, tourism grew when it became possible for the mass of people in the west to take cheap holidays in foreign countries. Three factors made this possible, transportation, cheap, easy and safe, and the necessary permission to international hotel chains and airlines to operate freely. The national committee will no doubt talk of incentives and infrastructure. It will reiterate the well-known that India should open up the tourism sector, allowing more cheap fares, encourage the growing flow of middle-income tourists in search of inexpensive holidays and develop destinations that are infrequently visited. It will spend time, no doubt in discussing industry concessions and initiatives, and review the procedures and red tape make for cumbersome travel and sightseeing in this country. But in the end, it will probably recognise that its best efforts will come up against its preview',

            'There is a sense of awe in the atmosphere as the nipping winds of winter pierce through ones body sending a chill down ones spine. The cold grows stifling and an overpowering numbness seizes ones entire existence. Trees shed their leaves and put on a bleak look; Fields look desolate. The sky wears mournful grey. But the Laws of Nature decree that winter cannot rule eternally. It is soon followed by spring and refreshing spring winds begin to blow. Their caressing touch rejuvenates life and there are sudden thrilling pulsations in the air. Streams gently roll, soft showering in ones ears. Flowers bloom and the air gets laden with soothing fragrance. The cyclic pattern of Nature is reflected in life as well. Suffering and misfortune may assail one for a while and envelop ones entire existence with drooping despair. But they must inevitably disappear and give way to hope and happiness as the fog disappears before the sun. If one can save ones vision from winter, he can perceive a silver lining. There is good deal of talk about ceiling and one naturally has to agree with it because one wants to remove disparities. But one has always to remember that the primary function of growing society is to produce more wealth otherwise it will not grow. There are many wrong statements made and much misunderstanding concerning the such and effects of introducing computers for commercial practice. It is wrongly supposed by many that computers are the answer to all difficulties, that their use will correct bad business practices and be the fairly God mother, converting losses into profits. It is believed that all that is necessary is to feed facts and figures into a computer and you will get a magic answer to any problem. This is not so, feed rubbish into a computer and you will get rubbish. After all, computers are only electronic machines relying on human skills to construct them, operate them, feed them with information from which an answer is required. The commercial use of these electronic magicians is for data processing, the organizing of data detailed information for which certain definite uses are planned, for example many large business organizations compile their payrolls by this means. Information is organized and fed into the machine and the result is a complete and detailed pay roll. The organization of the material is operated programming. The programme is the most important factor in computer work and those who undertake this work are specialists. Information is fed into the machine by means of punch cards, paper tape, or magnetic tape effectively over the page. People can thus have great help using computers',

            'A recent study conducted by leading scientists from around the world has unveiled a concerning trend: a significant decline in global bee populations. The findings of this study, published in the prestigious journal Nature, highlight the urgent need for action to address the threats facing bees, which play a crucial role in ecosystem health and food security. The study, a comprehensive analysis of bee populations spanning several continents, involved researchers collecting and analysing data from various sources, including field studies, academic literature, and government reports. The results paint a grim picture: bee populations have declined by an alarming 37% over the past decade, with certain regions experiencing even steeper declines. Several factors have been identified as contributing to the decline in bee populations. Habitat loss due to urbanization and agricultural expansion ranks among the top concerns. Pesticide use, particularly neonicotinoids, has also been implicated in bee declines, as these chemicals can interfere with bee navigational abilities and overall health. Climate change, disease, and parasites further exacerbate the challenges facing bee populations. Bees are essential pollinators, playing a critical role in the reproduction of flowering plants, including many crops that humans rely on for food. The decline in bee populations threatens not only the biodiversity of ecosystems but also agricultural productivity. A significant reduction in bee populations could lead to declines in crop yields, affecting food security and economic stability worldwide. The decline in bee populations poses a direct threat to food security, as approximately 75% of the world crops depend, at least in part, on pollination by bees and other pollinators. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, and oilseeds are among the crops most reliant on bee pollination. A decline in bee populations could result in reduced yields, increased food prices, and disruptions to global food supply chains. The findings of this study underscore the urgent need for action to address the threats facing bee populations. Conservation efforts must focus on preserving and restoring bee habitats, including the creation of pollinator-friendly landscapes in both urban and rural areas. Additionally, stricter regulations on pesticide use, particularly neonicotinoids, are necessary to protect bee health. Addressing the decline in bee populations requires collaboration on a global scale. Governments, scientists, farmers, and other stakeholders must work together to implement policies and practices that promote bee conservation and sustainable agriculture. International agreements, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, provide a framework for collective action to safeguard pollinators and biodiversity. Investment in research and innovation is essential for developing solutions to mitigate the threats facing bee populations. Scientists are exploring alternative pest management strategies, breeding more resilient bee species, and studying the impacts of climate change on bee habitats. Public and private funding for bee research and conservation initiatives is crucial for advancing these efforts. The alarming decline in global bee populations highlighted by this study is a wake-up call for humanity. The loss of bees poses a significant threat to ecosystems, agricultural productivity, and food security. Urgent action is needed to address the complex challenges facing bee populations, including habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change. By working together and prioritizing bee conservation efforts, we can protect these invaluable pollinators and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.',

            'Adversity can prove highly beneficial to mankind. It can bring one courage, maturity and understanding. Having once been through adverse circumstances, one is certain to face the rest of ones life with greater courage and confidence. Adversity also develops a mans capacity to sympathies with the suffering humanity. He who has never suffered can never understand what suffering is. The value of tears can be appreciated only by a man who has shed them himself. Adversity purifies a man. Gold, when it is melted in fire, gets purified. It is a proverbial saying that God sends us into deep water not to drawn us but to wash us clean. Adversity also provides a man with an opportunity to test the sincerity of those who claim to be sincere to him. Prosperity gains friends, adversity tries them. Besides, adversity, by contrast, enhances the pleasure of prosperity. Adversity can be really useful to man provided he has a positive attitude towards life. Thus, sweet are the fruits of adversity. Ever since man first walked on the earth, he has suffered from disease. People have tried to fight disease in many ways, by taking special herbs, by avoiding certain foods and even the practicing magic. Yet all the time that they were doing these things, they did not know how disease was caused. Today, we know that it is caused by very small living things which we cell germs. These germs harm us when they enter into our bodies. They do this in different ways. For example, the germ which causes malaria in us lives in the blood. When a mosquito bites someone who has malaria, it sucks in some of those germs. Later when it bites someone who is healthy, it passes the germs on to him. Flies too, carry the germs from an infected person to a healthy man. Fortunately, we have good natural defines against many germs. Our bodies are made up of millions of very small cells just as a building is made up of many tones or bricks. Some of these cells move about, eat away germs to stop them from harming us. We also make special substance on our bodies which attack germs for us. Some of these substances are always present in our bodies. For example, our tears contain some to protect our eyes and or saliva contains some to protect our mouths. Other substances are made inside our bodies when certain kinds of germ attack us. These substances are called and bodies and each protect us against only one kind of germ. As it happens, we cannot produce anti-bodies against every kind of germs. Another way of protecting ourselves against sickness it to stop the germs from ever reaching us. For this we have to hygienic in the way we live',

            'Do not worry, be happy. Take out all the worries from your mind. So always be happy, Worry makes you tense and affects the nerves. Whereas laughing and being happy will keep the whole body fit. Life is like a bicycle, when it is not moving it falls. A smile creates happiness. If costs nothing but gives a lot. If enriches those who give. We must live and enjoy every minute, every second of life. Where there are sorrows in our life, there is also happiness. A life of sacrifice is the art and is full of true joy. Until we taste the sorrow, we will not be able to know the meaning of true happiness. Life is a bundle of events which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Have courage for the great sorrows of life and patience for a small one. Sleep in peace, God is awake. Face all the problems of your life with a smiling face because sorrows and happiness are the two main things of life. So, always be cheerful and be bold, because without these things there is no meaning of life. Books are out true friends. They are our constant companions who stand by us through thick and thin. We happy in their company, they never desert us. We never lonely if we like to read. They give us courage to face lifes struggles, fill our hearts with hope, and cheer us when we are in despair. Light fiction and mystery novels help us to pass our leisure time in a pleasant manner. At the same time, they improve our language and sharpen our intellect and logical thinking. Books written by great personalities like Nehru, and biographies and autobiographies of great men, inspire us to strive for greatness. Many of us have been influenced by books written by great philosophers like Swami Vivekananda and Sri Arbindo, and as a result our lives have changed for the better. Travel books take us to countries we may, perhaps never be able to actually visit in our lives. They reveal to us the lifestyles and habits of people we have never seen. Historical books tell us about past tales and of great wars fought in the past. All of us like to read stories of the Rani of Jhansi and Shivaji. We read great epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata and learn a lot about our culture. A good book is a friend, philosopher and guide to all those who read it. Books are the best medium to pass on our knowledge and ideas to the future generations. Books are the windows to the world. A glimpse into books gives us a glimpse of the world. Just as it is necessary to choose our friends, it is also necessary to choose books carefully. The choice depends on our tastes and interest. Like our friends, our books should help us in our studies',

            'As the world continues its battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to vaccinate populations across the globe have reached a critical stage. While vaccination campaigns have been underway in many developed nations, reaching remote communities in developing countries has presented significant challenges. However, recent initiatives have shown promising progress in ensuring that even the most marginalized populations have access to life-saving vaccines. In remote regions of developing countries, accessing healthcare services can be a daunting task due to limited infrastructure, challenging terrain, and logistical hurdles. Despite these obstacles, health authorities and humanitarian organizations have been working tirelessly to bring COVID-19 vaccines to these underserved communities. Partnerships between governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and international agencies have been instrumental in facilitating the vaccination drive in remote areas. These collaborations have enabled the mobilization of resources, including vaccines, medical supplies, and trained healthcare workers, to reach communities that are often overlooked. Recognizing the unique needs and circumstances of remote populations, vaccination campaigns have adopted tailored approaches to ensure maximum coverage. Mobile vaccination clinics, outreach programs, and door-to-door campaigns have been deployed to overcome barriers such as transportation limitations and vaccine hesitancy. The vaccination drive in remote communities has not been without its challenges. Limited access to reliable transportation and cold chain infrastructure has posed logistical challenges in maintaining the integrity of the vaccines. Additionally, misinformation and mistrust of vaccines have hindered efforts to achieve high vaccination rates in some communities. Despite these challenges, there have been notable success stories in reaching remote communities with COVID-19 vaccines. In regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, vaccination teams have braved rugged terrain, extreme weather conditions, and cultural barriers to deliver vaccines to isolated villages and nomadic populations. Community engagement has played a crucial role in the success of vaccination campaigns in remote areas. Local leaders, community health workers, and grassroots organizations have been instrumental in building trust, dispelling myths, and encouraging vaccine uptake within their communities. The impact of vaccinating remote populations in developing countries extends beyond the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. By reaching these communities, vaccination efforts contribute to reducing disparities in healthcare access and strengthening health system resilience against future pandemics. The successful vaccination drive reaching remote communities in developing countries represents a significant milestone in the global fight against COVID-19. While challenges remain, the collaborative efforts of governments, NGOs, and local communities have demonstrated the importance of equity and inclusivity in vaccine distribution. As vaccination campaigns continue, it is essential to sustain momentum and ensure that no community is left behind in the quest to end the pandemic.',

            'When faced with a loss, crisis or life - changing event, we may be suddenly thrust into an unfamiliar world, one that is frightening and challenging. The first step towards coping with a loss is to accept the circumstances we are in. Non-acceptance or denial destroys peace of mind and gives rise to anger, anxiety and frustration. It may also lead to a feeling of self-pity. In such a case, a person resigns himself to his fate and loses his self-confidence. He is not able to cope with the reality. But a person who accepts the ups and downs of life and prepares himself to take life as a challenge gets a new strength from within to fight and succeed. The thought that there is nothing permanent in life, that highs must follow lows and lows have inevitably to be succeeded by highs can also prove to be encouraging. It can give us strength to face unfavourable circumstances with perseverance and fortitude. The crown and glory of life in character. It is neither power nor pelf nor even physical prowess but character alone that can bring glory to a man. Power corrupts and breeds bitterness and resentment; wealth is merely a passing shadow, endowing upon men but shadowy glamour, mere physical prowess is the attribute of a beast or a giant, it is only one character - invincible moral courage, unimpeachable integrity, that can bring one personal satisfaction and high esteem among others. Character constitutes one essence, what on really is. Want of character implies meaningless existence. If Gandhiji could transform the hearts of millions of people all over the world and shake the foundations of mighty British Empire, it was by virtue of his character, his unflinching faith in the earnestness of his cause and his unconquerable will power. He has immortalised himself because he was man of character. Character cannot be developed in a day. It takes years of self-exploration. Every day many people need to buy, and others wish to sell their goods. Whenever and whenever these people meet there is a market, but it is not a market place in the usual sense. It may be round a stall, in a shop or in a ware house or factory. There are large and famous market under one roof, such as the stock exchange, and the various commodity markets, such as the cotton, wool and tea exchange. But markets need not be under one roof. A number of men connected by telephone, or even walking in and out of banks and offices to deal with each other can be a market.',

            'In our day to-day life we exchange our ideas, thoughts and other information with our friends, relatives and other people. Sometimes we directly talk to them and sometimes we also write letters to them. In letters we express our feelings in a few words, we may ask for any information or we may write about a complaint in connection with our problems. Similarly, businessmen also exchange ideas, information by writing letters. They communicate business information to customers, suppliers and others and at the same time receive a variety of letters from them. We communicate our feelings, thoughts etc. to our friends and relatives through letters that may be called personal correspondence. A Businessman also writes and receives letters in his day to-day transactions, which may be called business correspondence. Business correspondence or business letter is a written communication between two parties. Businessmen may write letters to supplier of goods; he may write letters to Banks for loans. Student unrest has become a common feature of education all over the world. The good old days of struck obedience and difference shown to teachers and lecturers are things of the past. This is a sorry state of affairs when the present generation of youth are relied upon to be the future leaders of a nation. A student is not an exclusive entity in himself. He lives in a society where he interacts constantly with his own kith and kin, his friends and others, like teachers, peons, neighbours, vendors and so on. He is influenced by them to a certain degree and imbibes both virtuous and negative aspects from them. In todays society, we see many students spending or wasting their time on strikes and agitation when they should be in class pursuing better interests. They are a misguided lot and a different attitude on the part of teachers and principals is partly responsible for such a state of affairs. Students are also politically motivated and are seen joining demonstrations, slogan shouting, taking our processions against the Government, damaging and looting public property. This is compound by their resorting to addiction of drugs, alcohol and smoking. Such types of behaviour indicate a disturbed and restless mind. Our educational system needs to be revamped. Students are compulsorily made to learn subjects that have no bearing on the course that they want to pursue, or to their practical life. This leads them to frustration. The home atmosphere is also a cause for unrest among students because they are neglected by their parents who have hardly any time for them due to social engagements.',

            'John Keats, one of the celebrated romantic poets, begins his poem Endymion with this off - quoted line: A thing of beauty is a joy for ever. And he goes on to assert that its loveliness keeps increasing with the passage of time and it never passes into nothingness. Keats concept of beauty is quite comprehensive. It includes, besides physical beauty, mental excellence and moral purity. If an object is to be a source of permanent joy, it must be beautiful in its entirety and not just physically attractive. Skin deep beauty decays fast. But beauty ingrained in the tissues of an object is a permanent quality. The very touch of this kind of beauty comforts ones heart and elevates one mentally and morally. If we are surrounded by real beauty of the kind conceived of by Keats, it moves away the pal of darkness from our spirits and enables us to shed our despondency and regain our happiness. Not only physical beauty but moral purity and mental excellence is also important. Discipline is the great binding force of a nation. It is the backbone of a nation. It is not something that is talent in person, something that has to be cultivated. It is a long process that starts from the family to society, from the society to the nation. It is necessary in a society and nation for the world to function smoothly and effectively. It is a valuable asset at all levels of society. Imagine a family or a school where indiscipline prevails. Children from such environments grow up being aggressive and ill mannered. Discipline involves people in doing their duty judiciously, diligently and sincerely. It is the essence of life, whose absence results in a nation be set with anarchy and restlessness. It is necessary in every walk of life and in every activity. If there is discipline in school, a child will learn to behave and follow the rules that are set by schools. It is a teachers task in school the parents role at home a managers need in a company to inculcate the importance and sense of discipline in the citizens. For most adults, discipline is a natural quality that comes naturally. They should set good examples for youngsters to emulate them. Children and teenagers are swayed by popular trends and styles which distract them from their path of higher progress. So, they have to disciplined to move on the right path. They therefore need guidance from elders, teachers and parents. Discipline is born of a sense of responsibility among people. That is why European nations, and some Asian countries like Japan and Singapore, where you see a lot of discipline among their people, are so prosperous and powerful.',

            'In recent years, tech giants have come under intense scrutiny over their handling of user data and privacy practices. From Facebook to Google to Amazon, these companies have faced allegations of mishandling sensitive information, selling user data to third parties, and failing to adequately protect user privacy. As concerns grow among consumers and lawmakers alike, regulatory scrutiny and calls for reform have reached a fever pitch. The issue of data privacy has become increasingly prominent as technology continues to permeate every aspect of modern life. From social media platforms to e-commerce websites to smart home devices, users are constantly generating vast amounts of data, much of which is collected and stored by tech companies for various purposes, including targeted advertising, product development, and algorithmic optimization. However, the extent to which these companies collect and use data has raised significant concerns about privacy infringement and the potential for misuse. In recent years, numerous high-profile data breaches and scandals have underscored the risks associated with centralized data storage and lax data security measures. One of the most notable examples of data privacy controversy involves Facebook and its handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In 2018, it was revealed that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly obtained and used personal data from millions of Facebook users for political advertising purposes without their consent. The incident sparked outrage and led to calls for greater oversight of tech companies data practices. Similarly, Google has faced criticism for its data collection practices, particularly regarding the vast amounts of personal information it gathers through its various services, including search, email, and maps. Concerns have been raised about the company use of this data for targeted advertising and the potential for abuse of user privacy. Amazon, too, has come under fire for its handling of user data, particularly about its smart home devices such as the Echo and Ring. Privacy advocates have raised concerns about the devices always-on listening capabilities and the potential for unauthorized access to sensitive conversations and personal information. In response to mounting pressure, tech giants have taken steps to improve their data privacy practices and enhance transparency. Many companies have updated their privacy policies, implemented new data security measures, and introduced tools to give users greater control over their personal information. However, critics argue that these measures are not enough and that more comprehensive regulatory action is needed to address systemic issues related to data privacy and protection. In recent years, governments around the world have begun to take action to regulate the tech industry and hold companies accountable for their data practices. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has imposed strict requirements on companies operating in the European Union, including tech giants, regarding the collection, storage, and processing of user data. The GDPR has set a new standard for data privacy regulation and has prompted similar efforts in other jurisdictions. In the United States, lawmakers have introduced various proposals for federal privacy legislation aimed at establishing comprehensive guidelines for data privacy and protection. However, progress has been slow, with partisan divisions and industry lobbying posing significant obstacles to legislative action. As the debate over data privacy continues to evolve, the role of tech giants in shaping the future of privacy rights and protections remains a topic of intense scrutiny and debate. While companies have made efforts to improve their practices, concerns persist about the adequacy of existing regulations and the need for stronger enforcement mechanisms to hold tech giants accountable for their actions. In conclusion, tech giants face increased scrutiny over their data privacy practices as concerns grow about the collection, use, and protection of user data. While companies have taken steps to address these concerns, more comprehensive regulatory action is needed to ensure adequate privacy protections for users in an increasingly digital world.',

            'In a stark wake-up call to the world, a new report released by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has underscored the urgent need for immediate and decisive action to combat climate change. The report, compiled by hundreds of scientists from around the globe, warns that without significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the planet will face increasingly severe and irreversible impacts, ranging from extreme weather events to the loss of entire ecosystems. Titled Climate Change 2024: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, the report presents a comprehensive assessment of the current state of the climate and its projected future trajectory. Drawing on decades of research and observational data, the findings paint a grim picture of the consequences of continued inaction. One of the most alarming aspects of the report is its identification of the widespread and far-reaching impacts of climate change on both natural and human systems. Rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and sea-level rise are already exacerbating extreme weather events such as heatwaves, storms, and droughts, with devastating consequences for communities around the world. According to the report, vulnerable populations, including those in low-lying coastal areas, small island states, and arid regions, are particularly at risk. These communities often lack the resources and infrastructure needed to adapt to the rapidly changing climate, leaving them disproportionately exposed to its impacts. Furthermore, the report highlights the interconnectedness of climate change with other global challenges, such as food security, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss. Changes in temperature and precipitation are disrupting agricultural systems, reducing crop yields, and threatening the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on agriculture for their sustenance. The loss of biodiversity, driven in part by climate change, is also a major concern raised in the report. Ecosystems such as coral reefs, forests, and polar regions are experiencing unprecedented levels of stress, leading to declines in species abundance and diversity. These changes not only threaten the stability of ecosystems but also jeopardize essential ecosystem services upon which human societies rely, such as clean air, freshwater, and pollination. In light of these findings, the report emphasizes the need for immediate and ambitious action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement. This will require rapid and far-reaching transformations across all sectors of society, including energy, transportation, agriculture, and industry. The report also stresses the importance of adaptation measures to build resilience to the unavoidable impacts of climate change. Investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, early warning systems, and sustainable land management practices can help communities prepare for and respond to the challenges ahead. In response to the report, world leaders and policymakers are facing renewed pressure to prioritize climate action on the global agenda. Calls for stronger commitments to emissions reductions, increased climate financing for developing countries, and enhanced international cooperation are growing louder in the face of the escalating climate crisis. The urgency of the situation cannot be overstated. With each passing day, the window of opportunity to avert the most catastrophic effects of climate change narrows. The decisions we make now will determine the fate of future generations and the health of the planet for centuries to come. As the world grapples with the profound challenges posed by climate change, the findings of the IPCC report serve as a sobering reminder of the need for swift and decisive action. Only by working together, across borders and sectors, can we hope to address this existential threat and secure a sustainable future for all.',

            'As the world continues to grapple with the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions, global food prices have surged sharply, exacerbating food insecurity and placing immense pressure on vulnerable communities worldwide. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the global food price index rose by 12.1% in 2021, reaching its highest level since 2011. This dramatic increase has been driven by a combination of factors, including adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions, rising energy costs, and increased demand for staple food items. One of the primary drivers of the surge in food prices has been the impact of extreme weather events on agricultural production. Widespread droughts, floods, and wildfires have devastated crops in key food-producing regions, leading to reduced harvests and lower yields. In addition, disruptions to transportation and distribution networks have further constrained the availability of food supplies, driving up prices in local markets. The effects of rising food prices are being felt most acutely by vulnerable communities, particularly those in low- and middle-income countries where a significant portion of household income is spent on food. In these communities, families are being forced to make difficult choices between purchasing essential food items and meeting other basic needs such as healthcare and education. The situation is particularly dire in regions already grappling with conflict, political instability, and economic hardship, where access to food is already precarious. In countries such as Yemen, South Sudan, and Afghanistan, where millions of people are already facing severe food shortages, the rise in food prices is pushing even more individuals and families into hunger and poverty. Furthermore, the impact of rising food prices is not limited to developing countries. In many high-income countries, inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions have led to higher food prices, putting a strain on household budgets and exacerbating income inequality. Vulnerable populations, including low-income families, the elderly, and marginalized communities, are disproportionately affected by these price increases. The humanitarian implications of the global food price crisis are profound. In addition to exacerbating hunger and malnutrition, rising food prices can also lead to social unrest, political instability, and mass migration as people seek refuge from food insecurity and economic hardship. Addressing the root causes of the global food price crisis requires a concerted effort from governments, international organizations, and the private sector. Immediate measures are needed to support vulnerable communities and ensure access to affordable and nutritious food. This includes targeted food assistance programs, social safety nets, and measures to protect smallholder farmers and agricultural workers. Long-term solutions to the food price crisis must address underlying issues such as climate change, inequality, and unsustainable agricultural practices. Investments in climate-resilient agriculture, technology, and infrastructure are essential to building a more resilient food system that can withstand future shocks and ensure food security for all. Moreover, there is a pressing need for greater international cooperation and coordination to address the systemic challenges facing the global food system. This includes efforts to promote trade liberalization, reduce trade barriers, and strengthen food safety and quality standards. In conclusion, the sharp rise in global food prices is posing a significant threat to food security and stability worldwide, placing immense pressure on vulnerable communities already struggling to make ends meet. Urgent action is needed to address the root causes of the crisis and ensure access to affordable and nutritious food for all. Failure to act swiftly and decisively risks exacerbating hunger, poverty, and social unrest on a global scale.',

            'In recent years, tech giant Google has faced increasing scrutiny over its dominance in various digital markets, ranging from online search to digital advertising. Now, the company finds itself at the center of a global antitrust storm as multiple governments around the world file lawsuits alleging anti-competitive practices and monopolistic behaviour. The European Union, the United States, Australia, and other countries have all launched investigations and legal actions against Google, signaling a coordinated effort to rein in the company power and promote fair competition in the digital economy. At the heart of these antitrust lawsuits are allegations that Google has abused its dominant position in online search and digital advertising to stifle competition, restrict consumer choice, and harm innovation. Critics argue that Google control over search results and advertising revenue gives it an unfair advantage over rivals, making it difficult for smaller companies to compete on a level playing field. In the European Union, Google has been the target of multiple antitrust investigations and fines in recent years. The European Commission, the EU antitrust watchdog, has accused Google of prioritizing its own services and products in search results, while demoting rival offerings, thereby stifling competition and harming consumers. Google has been fined billions of euros for these anti-competitive practices, and the legal battles continue as the company appeals the decisions. In the United States, Google is facing antitrust lawsuits from both the Department of Justice (DOJ) and a coalition of state attorneys general. The DOJ lawsuit, filed in October 2020, alleges that Google has unlawfully maintained monopolies in online search and search advertising through exclusionary agreements and anticompetitive conduct. The lawsuit seeks to break up Google dominance and restore competition in the digital marketplace. Similarly, a group of state attorneys general filed a separate lawsuit against Google, accusing the company of engaging in anti-competitive practices to maintain its monopoly power. The lawsuit, which includes bipartisan support from 38 states and territories, focuses on Google control over online advertising and its impact on publishers, advertisers, and consumers. Australia has also taken action against Google, proposing new regulations to address the company dominance in online search and advertising. The proposed laws, known as the News Media Bargaining Code, aim to level the playing field between tech platforms like Google and news publishers by requiring them to negotiate fair compensation for the use of news content. Google initially opposed the legislation but eventually reached agreements with several Australian media companies to pay for their content. In response to the mounting legal challenges, Google has defended its business practices, arguing that its services benefit consumers and promote competition. The company contends that it faces robust competition in all of its markets and that its products and services have led to innovation, choice, and lower prices for consumers. However, critics remain sceptical of Google arguments, pointing to its dominant market share in online search and advertising as evidence of anti-competitive behaviour. They argue that Google control over the digital ecosystem gives it undue influence over the flow of information and commerce, raising concerns about privacy, data protection, and the fairness of online competition. As the antitrust lawsuits against Google continue to unfold, the outcomes could have far-reaching implications for the future of the digital economy. If successful, the legal actions could lead to structural changes in how tech platforms operate and could pave the way for greater competition and innovation in online markets. However, the complex nature of the cases and the deep pockets of tech companies like Google ensure that the legal battles will likely drag on for years to come.',

Calls for greater transparency, explainability, and accountability in AI decision-making processes are driving discussions about the need for regulatory oversight and ethical guidelines to ensure that AI is deployed in a manner that is consistent with societal values and norms. Amidst these debates, efforts to develop ethical AI principles and guidelines have gained momentum, with governments, industry stakeholders, and civil society organizations taking proactive steps to address the ethical challenges posed by AI. In 2021, the European Union unveiled its proposed regulations on AI, aiming to establish clear rules for the development and deployment of AI systems while ensuring respect for fundamental rights and values. Similarly, organizations such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Partnership on AI have published ethical guidelines and frameworks to promote responsible AI development and deployment. Furthermore, the role of interdisciplinary collaboration and public engagement is crucial in navigating the ethical complexities of AI. As AI technology continues to evolve, interdisciplinary dialogue involving experts from diverse fields, including ethics, law, sociology, and computer science, is essential for developing comprehensive approaches to address the ethical challenges posed by AI. Moreover, fostering public awareness and engagement is vital in ensuring that AI technologies are developed and deployed in a manner that reflects societal values and priorities. In conclusion, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has ignited a robust debate over its ethical use and regulation. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into society, stakeholders must grapple with complex questions about bias, privacy, accountability, and transparency. Efforts to develop ethical AI principles and regulatory frameworks are underway, but navigating the ethical terrain of AI requires interdisciplinary collaboration, public engagement, and a commitment to upholding fundamental rights and values in the digital age.',

            'As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of new variants of the virus has sparked concerns among health officials and researchers about the effectiveness of existing vaccines and the potential for increased transmission rates. These variants, which have been detected in various countries around the globe, present new challenges in the ongoing battle against the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 disease, has shown a remarkable ability to mutate over time. This natural process of evolution has led to the emergence of several variants, some of which have raised alarm among health experts due to their potential to evade immune responses and spread more easily from person to person. One of the most concerning variants identified is the Delta variant, initially detected in India. This variant has since spread to numerous countries and has been associated with increased transmissibility compared to earlier strains of the virus. Studies have also suggested that the Delta variant may partially evade immunity conferred by vaccines, leading to breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. The emergence of variants like Delta has prompted renewed scrutiny of vaccine effectiveness against these new strains. While vaccines have proven to be highly effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death caused by COVID-19, questions remain about their ability to provide complete protection against certain variants. Researchers are actively studying the efficacy of existing vaccines against different variants and exploring the need for booster doses or updated vaccine formulations to better target these evolving strains. In addition to concerns about vaccine effectiveness, the spread of new variants has raised worries about increased transmission rates and the potential for renewed surges in COVID-19 cases. More transmissible variants can lead to faster spread within communities, making it challenging to control outbreaks and maintain public health measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing. Public health officials emphasize the importance of continued vigilance and adherence to preventive measures, especially in areas where variants of concern are circulating. Robust surveillance systems are essential for monitoring the spread of variants and identifying any changes in their behaviour or impact on vaccine effectiveness. This information is crucial for informing public health responses and adjusting strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus. Efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 variants also include ongoing vaccination campaigns aimed at achieving high levels of population immunity. Vaccination remains one of the most effective tools for controlling the pandemic and reducing the risk of severe illness and transmission. Health authorities encourage eligible individuals to get vaccinated as soon as possible and to receive booster doses as recommended, particularly in regions where variants of concern are prevalent. In addition to vaccination, other strategies such as testing, contact tracing, isolation of cases, and promoting adherence to public health guidelines play a critical role in controlling the spread of COVID-19 variants. Collaboration between governments, public health agencies, researchers, and the global community is essential for coordinating efforts to monitor and respond to the evolving threat posed by variants of the virus. While the emergence of new variants presents challenges in the fight against COVID-19, ongoing research and surveillance efforts offer hope for better understanding and managing these evolving strains. By remaining vigilant, continuing to prioritize vaccination, and implementing evidence-based public health measures, communities around the world can work together to reduce the impact of variants and ultimately bring an end to the pandemic.',

            'Moreover, issues related to bias and fairness in technology cannot be overlooked. Machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence systems often inherit biases present in the data used to train them. This can lead to discriminatory outcomes, reinforcing existing social inequalities. Ethical considerations demand that technologists actively address and rectify biases in algorithms to ensure fairness and equity. Transparency in the development process and regular audits of algorithms can contribute to minimizing unintended biases. As technology permeates various aspects of our lives, its impact on employment raises ethical concerns. The advent of automation and artificial intelligence has the potential to displace numerous jobs, leading to economic and social ramifications. Ethical responsibility lies in anticipating these disruptions and proactively implementing measures such as skilling programs to ensure a smooth transition for the workforce. Striking a balance between technological innovation and societal well-being requires a comprehensive approach that considers the ethical implications of unemployment and inequality. Another critical ethical dimension involves the environmental impact of technology. The relentless pursuit of innovation often leads to the production of electronic waste and increased energy consumption. Ethical responsibility necessitates the development and adoption of sustainable practices in technology. This includes designing products with recyclability in mind, reducing energy consumption, and promoting responsible disposal methods. Technology companies must actively engage in eco-friendly practices to mitigate their environmental footprint. The issue of accessibility highlights yet another facet of ethical considerations in technology. As innovations unfold, it is essential to ensure that technological advancements are accessible to all members of society. This includes addressing issues of affordability, digital literacy, and creating user interfaces that cater to diverse needs. Ethical responsibility requires a commitment to bridging the digital divide and ensuring that technological benefits are inclusive. The rapid pace of technological innovation often outstrips the development of ethical frameworks, creating a gap that poses challenges for society. Ethical responsibility in technology calls for a proactive approach to anticipate potential ethical dilemmas and address them before they become societal issues. This involves not only compliance with existing regulations but also engaging in ethical foresight to navigate the uncharted territories of technological advancements. In conclusion, ethics in technology is a complex and evolving domain that requires continuous attention and commitment.',

            'In a region, when the population is subdivided as per the age groups this is called the age structure of the population. Age structure is useful for the projection of population and for understanding the dynamics of the age structure arrangement. Similarly, it also helps in understanding the proportion of active and dependent population. In India, the productive population is the population between the ages. This group of people is active in service and business. They directly participate in the economic activities of a region. In regions where the proportion of this population is more, especially youth, development is rapid. The dependant population fall into two sub groups. The people below 15 years of age are totally dependent on the productive population. People above 60 years also fall in the dependant category but their knowledge and experience make them a valuable asset to the whole society. The population of a region can be classified into working a nonworking group. These people who are not in jobs or professions, despite being in the productive age group, come under the nonworking group. This nonworking group is dependent on the working group. If the proportion of working population is higher in a region, then the population is termed as industrious. Such a region has repaid development. Students-teacher relationship, prejudice and racism are the major themes of the novel. Braithwaite gets a job of a teacher in a rather rough and notorious school. He finds that the students belong to a background that is not suitable for learning and their overall developmint and progress. He notices that the students are in no mood to change their attitude and behaviour. Braithwaite with his novel and creative ideas, innovative techniques and understanding the students psychology, ultimately wins their hearts in no time. Though he was bullied, harassed, mentally and physically tortured many times, he did not lose his patience and continued implementing his novel ideas and techniques that helped him to bring a significant change in his students lives. The racism prevalent in Great Britain during the mid the time period during which To Sir, with Love takes place, is of primary significance in the novel. The narrator cites repeated incidents in which he experiences the racism of white Britons, including encounters on the bus, at job interviews, at Greenslade school, when searching for housing, at a restaurant with his girlfriend and so on. At the outsit, Braithwaite is struck by the unexpectedness of such prejudice. He was brought up in British Guiana and he viewed himself.',

            'These are characteristic clouds which are indicators of thunderstorm. These look like huge mountains. These are dense and dark in colour. There is thunder accompanied by lightening. They bring rain with storm and may sometime bring hailstones. But such a type of rain does not last long. The largest of these clouds bring rainfall accompanied with lightning. The top portion of these clouds has an anvil like shape. The clouds have a positive charge at the upper and negative charge at the lower end. The land below them always has negative charge. Due to difference in the charges, electric chargers are formed and lighting occur lighting up the sky for a moment. The air around the lighting rises up because of the heat and this leads to a large thundering sound. As compared to other clouds, the rain drops of these clouds are larger because they move up and down a lot of times and accumulate more and more water. Drops become larger and larger and are unable to float in the clouds because of their weight. They fall in the form of rain. Sometimes, the air in the clouds is very cold. As a result, these drops freeze and fall in the form of hail. We call them hailstones. Raindrops coming towards the earth are stopped in the clouds itself because of strong vertical winds which change into hail.

            'All of us now what rubber is. We see rubber types. We play games with rubber balls; we wear rubber shoes during the rainy season. We also use sometimes small pieces of rubber to erase mistakes in writing. Rubber is an interesting substance. It changes its shape when we press it. As soon as we stop pressing it, it springs back to its first shape. We, therefore, say that rubbers elastic. It bounces too. When we throw a rubber ball on the ground, it bounces. Rubber is also water proof. We call a thing waterproof when water cannot get through it. These qualities have made rubber very useful in modern life. We get rubber from rubber tress. These trees give a milk white juice. It is obtained by cutting the bark of the trees. The juice that comes out is gathered in cups. These cups are attached to the trees. Rubber trees grow only in countries where it is very hot. So it was in these countries that people searched for rubber trees. In recent years rubber of successful attempts have been made. Desert Vegetation: These climatic conditions are reflected in the landscape by a characteristic type of vegetation cover. Contrary to popular impression, very few parts of the deserts are entirely barren. Such bare places do occur, but they are rare. Even the grate sandy deserts have a scattering of drought-resistant shrubs in the hollows between the dunes, and where water seepage brings moisture near the surface the result is a profusion of plants. The typical desert scene includes a cover of low shrubs and grasses, which at least after a rain, gives the landscape a distinctly greenish tinge. The vegetation that can exist under these extreme conditions of drought and high evaporation must be especially adapted to them. This accomplished in various ways. The annuals evade the drought by lying dormant during the long dry period, springing into bloom and rapidly completing the life cycle during the rare intervals when water is available. Then there are the perennials which endure the drought, quickly sending forth leaves and stems during the periods of rain, but remaining brown and apparently dead as long as no moisture reaches them. There are also the succulent plants, such as the cacti, these resist the drought by storing water inside their roots and stems, protecting themselves from evaporation by thick bark, by narrow hairy, or waxy leaves, or by a complete absence of leaves. Such plants are protected also from the attacks of thirsty animals by an armament of thorns. Desert plants usually grow some distance apart and have a remarkable development of the root system-both laterally to catch the infrequent rains',

            'Amidst escalating conflicts and the worsening impacts of climate change, the world is facing a deepening hunger crisis as food supplies become increasingly disrupted. Across continents, millions of people are struggling to access nutritious food, with vulnerable communities bearing the brunt of these interconnected crises. In conflict-ridden regions such as Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, and Afghanistan, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate rapidly. Armed conflicts and violence have not only displaced millions of people but have also disrupted agricultural activities, destroyed infrastructure, and hindered humanitarian aid delivery. As a result, food insecurity levels have reached alarming levels, with millions facing severe hunger and malnutrition. In Yemen, the ongoing civil war has plunged the country into one of the world worst humanitarian crises. The conflict has decimated agricultural production, disrupted food distribution networks, and left millions of Yemenis on the brink of starvation. According to the United Nations, more than 20 million people in Yemen are food insecure, with over 16 million in need of urgent assistance to survive. Similarly, in Syria, nearly a decade of conflict has devastated the country agricultural sector, leading to widespread food shortages and soaring prices. Millions of Syrians are unable to afford basic food items, pushing them further into poverty and hunger. The situation is exacerbated by the displacement of millions of people within the country and the influx of refugees into neighbouring countries, placing additional strain on already limited resources. In South Sudan, protracted conflict, coupled with climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods, has exacerbated food insecurity and malnutrition. Nearly half of the population, or approximately 6.5 million people, are facing acute hunger, with millions dependent on humanitarian aid for survival. The situation is particularly dire for children, with many suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Beyond conflict zones, the impacts of climate change are exacerbating food insecurity and pushing vulnerable communities to the brink of starvation. Erratic weather patterns, prolonged droughts, floods, and extreme temperatures are disrupting agricultural production, destroying crops, and diminishing livestock, particularly in regions already prone to food insecurity. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, recurring droughts are threatening food supplies and livelihoods, leaving millions of people without enough to eat. In East Africa, the recent locust infestation has further exacerbated food shortages, posing a significant threat to food security in the region. In Asia, countries like Bangladesh and India are grappling with the impacts of climate change on food production, particularly in coastal areas vulnerable to rising sea levels and extreme weather events. Cyclones, floods, and saline intrusion are destroying crops and jeopardizing food supplies, pushing vulnerable communities deeper into poverty and hunger. Addressing the global hunger crisis requires urgent and coordinated action from the international community. Humanitarian organizations are working tirelessly to provide food assistance, nutrition support, and livelihood opportunities to affected populations. However, these efforts are hindered by funding shortages, logistical challenges, and access constraints in conflict-affected areas. In addition to short-term relief efforts, long-term solutions are needed to address the root causes of food insecurity, including conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and climate adaptation measures. Investing in sustainable agriculture, resilient food systems, and social protection programs can help build the resilience of communities and reduce their vulnerability to future crises. The global hunger crisis is a stark reminder of the urgent need for collective action to address the intersecting challenges of conflict, climate change, and food insecurity. As the world grapples with these complex issues, prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable and marginalized communities must remain a top priority to ensure a future where no one goes hungry.',

            'The people were tall in stature, remarks Huian Tsang. they were always grateful for any kindness done to them. They were faithful and honest and always kept their promise. They lived simple lives and were generally vegetarian. Respectable persons did not eat onions or garlic. Women moved about freely in society; there was not purdah. Most of the people preferred clothes which were white and fresh looking. Women wore long robes. The caste system was strong and rigid as ever and the Shudras were not treated well. Large contributions in money and kind were made to the monasteries by the people. Harsha royal kitchens provided food for a thousand Buddhists and five hundred Brahmans every day. A village was the smallest unit of the community. It was generally self-sufficient. Harsha became a Buddhist in last life, but he continued to worship Lord Shiva and the Sun God, Surya. Each five years, he went on a pilgrimage to Prayag. While there, he gave everything he had. Collection of evidence in evaluation is followed by its analysis and interpretation which make matters still worse. This may be attributed to the blinkered approach chiefly followed by its users. While analysing evidence, its context is often ignored. Not only that, even the richness of the inputs is ignored and often background of a learner is disregarded. Similarly, while interpreting evidence we tend to forget the basic assumptions of the scale that is employed for assessing students on a hundred- and one-point scale. That is, on this scale zero is not an absolute zero, nor is hundred the absolute hundred; that zero does not represent nothingness of an attribute and that hundred does not represent the acquisition of the subject to the level of mastery; that the entire scale from zero to hundred is divided into hundred units of unequal sizes, that the difference between any two consecutive units does not remain the same as we move from the left to the right side of the scale. To top it all what is even worse is that an individual’s performance is always viewed vis-a-vis the performance or his or her peer group. Other equally significant aspects like students performance with reference to his or her own self and also with reference to the criteria laid down in terms of expected levels of attainments are not taken into consideration. In preceding paragraphs, we have also talked about two vital variables which too have far-reaching consequences in testing of human potential. They are; the quality of instruments and the efficiency of observers. Let us take them one by one. The quality of test papers is invariable questioned because of their varying difficulty values',

            'None but a fool is always right. We must be knowing people who always claim to be right. However fanciful, irrelevant or absurd their views on a subject may be, they assert they are right and are not prepared to brook any contradiction of challenge. Their cocksureness makes them presumptuous and this nature destroys all possibilities of acquiring knowledge. The first step towards knowledge is the realisation of ones ignorance. How can a person who does not realise his ignorance ever be curious to acquire knowledge. He contemptuously looks upon all opinions that differ from what he says and denies himself all possibilities of learning anything new. He is convinced that others are wrong while he is right. Then he fails to learn what is actually right. Darkness cannot be light, but unless a person realises that he is wallowing in darkness, he can have no desire of going into light. Wisdom ever keeps away from such a person. He is doomed to unrelieved folly. A question that is often asked by people is, why in we have not changed from numerical all these years marking to grading. The answer to that would seem to be: when a discipline originates it starts with a rudimentary knowledge which gradually traverses towards precision and improvement. Another answer could be ignorance, inertia and lack of will. When we resorted to the use of numerical marking system, our understanding of the subject was nominal. The only consideration at that point of time was to quantity students performance for the purpose of arriving at a variety of decisions. This gave rise to the development of an internal scale with a minimum of zero on the side and a maximum of hundred on the other side of the scale with the assumption that the entire scale is divided into hundred units of equal size. This found favour and over the years it was so institutionalized that people found it difficult to accept that student’s achievement can be expressed in any other form than the numerical marks. This was the time when there was little understanding of the significance of a balanced question paper, intra and inter-examiner variability, factors contributing to error in measurement, content validity, reliability criterion-referenced measurement, self-referenced measurement, norm referenced measurement, in adequacies and imperfection of interval scale etc. with the passage of time, new ideas emerged. Attempts were initiated to perfect evaluation procedures. Measurement and evaluation emerged as a separate discipline. It attached the best of the minds and of them, some had very solid the background',

            'The most important day I remember in all my life is the one on which my teacher, Anne Mansfield Sullivan, came to me. I am filled with wonder when I consider the immeasurable contrasts between the two lives which it connects. It was the third of March, 1887, three months before I was seven years old. On the afternoon of that eventful day, I stood on the porch, dumb and expectant. I guessed vaguely from my mothers signs and from the ferrying to and for in the house that something unusual was about to happen, so I went to the door and waited on the steps. The afternoon sun penetrated the mass of honey suckle that covered the porch, and fell on my upturned face. My fingers lingered almost unconsciously on the familiar loaves and blossoms which had just come forth to greet the sweet Southern spring. I did not know what the future held of marvel or surprise for me. Anger and bitterness had preyed upon me continually for weeks and a deep languer had succeeded this passionate struggle. Have you over been at sea in a donse fog, when it seemed as if a tangible white darkness shut you in, and the great ship, tense and anxious, groped her way toward the shore with plummet and sounding-line, and you waited with beating heart for something to happen. I was like that ship before my education began. India is a land of villages. A major portion of our population lives in villages. Cities are few. Obviously, the prosperity of our nation depends upon the prosperity of our villages. Since Independence, Indian villages have undergone quite a lot of change, but there is much more that needs to be done. Villages still face problems like illiteracy, poverty, unemployment and scarcity of water and electricity. During the freedom struggle, Gandhiji had called upon students to go to the villages and work for the upliftment of the villagers. But a student can act only as a part time social worker. He cannot make changes in the law or influence the basic structure of the village. This has to be done by the Government. For rural development, education is of the utmost importance. Many villages lack schools and teachers. Teachers must be given incentives to go and teach in the villages, and regular checks must be kept on the quality of teaching. Health care is very important',

            'Each student can get lifelong education. The student will get the information and knowledge from formal and informal education system. Every student has aspiration for new knowledge and he tries for it. The awareness of self learning is essential to provide the proper direction to these efforts made by the student. To do this ultimately the responsibility lies on teacher. Teachers role is more important in the process of self learning. Reading ability and activity of the student can change by self learning. Through self learning the cognitive, affective and psychomotor ability of the student can change. It is useful for making effective teaching learning process. The student can apply this knowledge in day today life. The physical, social, moral and aesthetic development of student is caused by self learning. It helps to speed the personality development of the student. The student establishes the positive effective communication through it. The teacher has to create the conductive situation in school environment, students awareness of learning for effective, joyful education process. The relations are built among the student and teacher in respect of physical infrastructure and education system by providing these amenities for education of self learning and regular studies. The teacher-taught relationship has undergone tremendous change in recent years. Materialism has stuck deep roots in our thoughts and our teachers are more concerned about their own prospects than about those of their students. As a result, the student feels let down and confused, unable to find anyone to give him proper guidance. Mal administration of academic institutions is also responsible for indiscipline among students. We cannot neglect the effects of mass-media on the students. With the fast developing means of communication the world is coming closer day by day and the developments in one corner of the globe do not fail to effect others. If a student-led revolution takes place in some country, their actions will naturally influence their counterparts in India. Students have been in the fore-front in bringing about political upheavals in different parts of the world, and no wonder, the Indian students feel they can do something similar here too. Student unrest is a social problem. It is to be tackled by responsible leaders and public-spirited men of society. The important remedy to the problem is that efforts should be made to increase opportunities of employment and education should be, as such, geared towards more of professional career than mere academic persuits. Academic environment should be improved.',

            'In the wake of widespread social justice movements advocating for equality and inclusion, major companies across various industries are stepping up their efforts to promote diversity and foster inclusive workplace environments. Recognizing the importance of addressing systemic inequalities, these companies are implementing new initiatives and policies aimed at creating more equitable opportunities for employees from diverse backgrounds. From tech giants to financial institutions and beyond, companies are acknowledging the need for meaningful action to combat discrimination and promote diversity at all levels of their organizations. The renewed focus on diversity and inclusion comes amid heightened awareness of racial and gender disparities, spurred by movements such as Black Lives Matter and #MeToo. One notable example of corporate commitment to diversity and inclusion is seen in the technology sector. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook have announced ambitious initiatives to increase the representation of underrepresented groups, particularly in leadership roles. These initiatives include targeted recruitment efforts, diversity training programs, and mentorship opportunities for employees from marginalized communities. Google, for instance, has pledged to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in leadership positions and has allocated significant resources to support diversity initiatives within the company. Microsoft has also made diversity and inclusion a top priority, with CEO Satya Nadella emphasizing the importance of creating an inclusive culture where all employees feel valued and respected. In the financial sector, major banks and investment firms are also ramping up their efforts to promote diversity and inclusion. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America are among the companies that have announced initiatives to address racial and gender disparities within their organizations. These initiatives include hiring targets for underrepresented groups, diversity training for employees, and support for minority-owned businesses. Goldman Sachs, for example, recently announced a $10 billion initiative to invest in businesses owned by Black women over the next decade. The initiative aims to address the longstanding barriers faced by Black women entrepreneurs and promote economic empowerment within marginalized communities. Beyond the tech and financial sectors, companies in industries ranging from retail to healthcare are also making strides toward greater diversity and inclusion. Retail giant Walmart, for instance, has implemented diversity training programs for its employees and has committed to increasing the representation of women and people of colour in leadership positions. Similarly, healthcare companies like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer are prioritizing diversity and inclusion in their workforce initiatives. These companies have implemented diversity recruiting strategies, mentorship programs for employees from underrepresented groups, and initiatives to address healthcare disparities among marginalized communities. The shift toward greater diversity and inclusion in corporate America reflects a growing recognition of the benefits of a diverse workforce. Research has shown that diverse teams are more innovative, productive, and better equipped to solve complex problems. By embracing diversity and creating inclusive workplace cultures, companies not only enhance their bottom line but also contribute to broader social progress. However, while many companies are taking positive steps toward diversity and inclusion, there is still much work to be done. Achieving true equality and representation requires ongoing commitment and sustained effort from all stakeholders. Companies must continue to prioritize diversity and inclusion in their hiring practices, promotion decisions, and organizational culture to create truly equitable workplaces. In conclusion, major companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace and are taking concrete steps to address systemic inequalities. By implementing initiatives aimed at increasing the representation of underrepresented groups and fostering inclusive cultures, these companies are not only strengthening their own organizations but also contributing to broader efforts to promote equality and social justice.',

            'Advertising renders large-scale production possible by creating demand on a wider scale as compared with the individual efforts of salesmen. Many a times, the publicity program are undertaken simultaneously with the embarking of a new venture; and thus, advertising paves the way for quicker distribution which in its turn facilitates the production in advance and on a large scale. Advertising, in a way helps reducing prices for the consumers through the lowering of cost of production. The demand stimulated by advertising, induces manufacturers and investors to undertake greater and larger production of the popular articles which means working under increasing returns and with economics of large scale functioning. Large scale production is necessarily a cheaper production. It not only helps reducing prices, but also reduces the fluctuations in prices as many a times standard products are advertised, disclosing the prices. This is particularly true of branded articles. Manufactures attempt to win over the retailers by publishing the prices so that there will be no scope for any cheating by the sellers. Once the prices are known, the competing retail merchants cannot sell at varying prices. Advertising benefits the industry by lessening the of distribution because it does away with the necessity. Secondary Market is a market where securities are traded. It is a place which provides liquidity to the securities issued in the Primary Market. The secondary market is represented by the stock exchange which provides an organised market place for investors to buy and sell securities. In other words, trading of securities subsequent to its primary offering takes place in secondary market. The secondary market induce investors to continuously rearrange their investments if they wish so. The initial buyer in the Primary Market may re-offer his securities to any interested buyer at mutually acceptable price. The stock exchange provides a market place where such mutually acceptable price may be determined. This active role of Secondary Market promoters growth of the Primary Market and encourages capital formation because investors in the primary market are assured of continuous and ready market for their investment. They can liquidate their securities in the stock exchange at any time.',

            'While conventional wisdom has it that a person is in a far stronger position if he is in a job, it may not always guarantee that he looks at the widest choice of options. The major cause of employment is the insufficient expansion of opportunities of work in relation to the increasing population of the country. In view of the underdeveloped conditions of the country, this deficiency can be made up only by a vigorous, adequate and many-sided programme of economic development. The problem of unemployment should therefore be tackled on all front and, more practically, by the organised growth of cottage and village industries, on an efficient basis as well as by other production and development schemes, which utilised this labour, increasing the purchasing power of the people, and add to general production. The problem of employment for those who receive education in schools and colleges is also becoming difficult. The number of such persons has increased out of proportion to the possible opening of the kind sought by them in present conditions, and the quality and kind of education which they receive is in many cases, not wall adapted to the present requirements. The educational system should, be recognised from this point of view. When writing a cheque a few simple precautions should be taken to avoid forgery. Both the name of the person to whom the cheque is drawn, and the amount in words and figures should begin as far as possible to the left, so that no words or figures can be fraudulently inserted. A line should be rules in any blank spaces remaining after the words and figures. Apart from its usefulness as a means of keeping a record of spending, the habit of making payments by cheque has many advantages. The payment of accounts is simplified, there is no necessity to go to the post office for postal orders to registered envelopes when sending money by post. Further, while a cheque does not constitute a legal receipt, it affords a valuable evidence that the payment has been made. A cheque book should always be kept in a safe place, but if it should be lost or stolen the customer should notify the bank at once so that arrangements can be made to protect his interests. Similarly the bank must be advised if an individual cheque is lost, stolen or mislaid. Unless prior arrangements have been made with the bank for an account to be overdrawn, under no circumstances should a cheque be drawn which exceeds the amount of the balance standing to his credit. A crossed cheque will not be paid out across the counter. Some is to be deposited.',

            'The old cities were never built to accommodate such a great movement from the rural areas and small towns. The sudden enlargement of residential areas has not been much planned. With the expansion of cities many slums that were on the periphery of the city are now in the midst of developed areas. Affluence and poverty side by side seems a good adjustment. But the health hazards have not been limited to the hut; they are immediately affected in the better localities too. An epidemic that starts in slums snowballs into the city as well. Moreover, the slums are so conjusted, and the amenities are so little, that the dwellers are generally on a warpath against one another near water taps. With all its intellectualism and modern living, urbanisation is responsible for artificiality, breaking of family ties, and utter loss of emotional relations. Freedom from the bondage of old customs and superstitious is welcome. But the vagaries of addiction to drugs and psychological problems in the material word of big cities cannot be underestimated. Environmental pollution due to automobiles had added one more misery to the vast expansion of cities. A young man who moves to the city for education would not like to go back to the rural setting to lead a rough and coarse life. Thus the education concentrate in the cities. India is a land of villages. A major portion of our population lives in villages. Cities are few. Obviously, the prosperity of our nation depends upon the prosperity of our villages. Since Independence, Indian villages have undergone quite a lot of change, but there is much more that needs to be done. Villages still face problems like illiteracy, poverty, unemployment and scarcity of water and electricity. During the freedom struggle, Gandhiji had called upon students to go to the villages and work for the upliftment of the villagers. But a student can act only as a part time social worker. He cannot make changes in the law or influence the basic structure of the village. This has to be done by the Government. For rural development, education is of the utmost importance. Many villages lack schools and teachers. Teachers must be given incentives to go and teach in the villages, and regular checks must be kept on the quality of teaching. Health care is very important.',

            'Cleanliness is next to Godliness - Certainly this is a duty, not a sin. It is absolutely necessary for ones self-respect. A person who is clean and tidy in how the dresses up commands better respect from those around him than the one who has a slovenly and unkempt appearance. It is extremely essential for each of us to keep ourselves, our houses and neighbourhood clean. This is necessary for ones and the nations health and hygiene. Dirt and grime are the causes of ill health and suffering, giving rise to diseases and epidemics. Plagues and epidemics that set in are called by filthy and insanitary unhygienic conditions. So it the duty of every citizen to ensure that public places and our own surroundings are not littered. A great percentage of our population live below the poverty line. The slums in metropolitan areas are inhabited by these poor people, most of whom have migrated from villages. Unable to earn a decent means of living. They live in shacks and huts, having no proper sanitation or drinking water. The one or two pipes that they have is surrounded by filth and stagnan water infested with mosquitoes and other creatures. Pigs, cows, dogs, etc. add to the filthy conditions. Now-a-days our Government also taking remarkable steps to maintain cleanliness especially in public places. The pattern of energy consumption in rural areas is important in any understanding of rural energy developments. With this end in view, let us examine the type of energy usage that takes place in the rural areas. Human Society acts on nature to produce either food or goods which are then consumed. Unlike animals, human beings not only acquire but also transform natural produce. Any such transformation requires energy as a necessary input. Energy and production always go hand in hand. Higher the level of production, higher generally is the level of energy utilisation. In this context, electricity, oil and coal are the common commercial energy sources which are being used in rural areas. Rural electrification was set as an important social goal in the India planning process. It was felt that the impact of electrification should not be considered in terms of narrow economic cost benefits but looked upon as an investment in terms of modernisation for the rural areas',

            'In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work has emerged as a transformative force, reshaping not only how people work but also where they choose to live. As companies embrace flexible work arrangements and employees seek greater work-life balance, urban planning, and real estate markets are experiencing significant shifts to accommodate these remote work trends. 1) Urban Planning Adaptations: Cities around the world are reevaluating their urban planning strategies to accommodate the growing demand for remote work-friendly environments. One notable trend is the emphasis on creating mixed-use developments that integrate residential, commercial, and recreational spaces within proximity. This approach reduces the need for long commutes and fosters vibrant, walkable communities where residents can live, work, and play. Moreover, urban planners are prioritizing the development of green spaces, public parks, and outdoor amenities to enhance the quality of life for remote workers. Access to nature and recreational opportunities has become increasingly important as people seek environments that support their physical and mental well-being, especially in light of prolonged periods spent indoors during lockdowns. Additionally, there is a growing focus on improving digital infrastructure, including high-speed internet connectivity and smart technology integration, to support remote work capabilities. Cities are investing in upgrading broadband networks and implementing digital initiatives to ensure reliable internet access and facilitate remote collaboration and communication. Impact on Real Estate Markets: The shift towards remote work has had a profound impact on the real estate market, driving changes in housing preferences and demand patterns. Suburban and rural areas are experiencing a surge in popularity as remote workers seek larger homes with dedicated office spaces, outdoor areas, and access to nature. As a result, there is a growing trend of urban dwellers relocating to less densely populated areas in search of affordable housing, better quality of life, and a quieter environment conducive to remote work. This has led to increased demand for single-family homes, townhouses, and rural properties, driving up prices in suburban and exurban markets. Conversely, some urban areas are facing challenges as demand for downtown apartments and condominiums wanes. High-rise buildings and densely populated urban cores are seeing decreased occupancy rates and declining rental prices as remote workers seek more spacious and affordable housing options outside of city centres. Furthermore, the rise of remote work has spurred a re-evaluation of office space needs, with many companies downsizing their physical footprints or adopting flexible office arrangements. Commercial real estate markets are grappling with vacancies and changing tenant preferences, prompting landlords to repurpose office buildings for mixed-use developments or alternative uses such as residential conversions or co-working spaces. 2) Future Implications: The remote work revolution is expected to have long-term implications for urban planning and real estate markets. As remote work becomes more entrenched in the post-pandemic era, cities will continue to adapt and evolve to meet the needs of remote workers and their families. Urban planners will need to prioritize sustainability, connectivity, and quality of life in designing future cities and neighbourhoods. Investments in public transportation, green infrastructure, and digital connectivity will be essential to support remote work and promote equitable access to opportunities for all residents. In the real estate market, developers and investors will need to respond to shifting demand dynamics by diversifying their portfolios and focusing on innovative, adaptable spaces that cater to the evolving needs of remote workers. Flexibility, affordability, and accessibility will be key drivers of success in the post-pandemic real estate landscape. In conclusion, the remote work trends reshaping urban planning and real estate markets represent a paradigm shift in how we live, work, and interact with our built environment. By embracing these changes and proactively addressing the evolving needs of remote workers, cities and real estate markets can thrive in the digital age.',

            'India is a poor country that is mostly constituted of villages. The teeming millions reside in the rural areas here some of the people live even without good potable drinking water. On the other hand, are the large cities that are bursting at their seams with urban population, where the infrastructure is unsuitable to give shelter to all its citizens. In the capital city of Delhi, or the congested city of Mumbai, slums keep mushrooming, for there is a general movement of the masses from the surrounding rural areas to these cities in search of jobs. Unable to find jobs, and nowhere to live, they resort to begging. There is a general belief among foreigners visiting India that begging has been prevalent here for centuries. Not so, it started with the decline of cottage industries when the British ruled India. It was the time when the general poverty in India was at its worst. The British had the people working for them more or less as Slaves, doing all the menial work for them. Very few Indians were in their top hierarchy. This is when begging set in as the destitute had to live on the charity of others, having no income of their own. You can still see beggars in large cities where they live side by side with the rich. Their jhuggijhompris are getting legalised as the politicians seek votes. His original name was Davidas Debuji Maharaj who was born in Shedgaon village in Anjangaon Surji Taluka in Amravati District of Maharashtra to a Dhobi Family. A public teacher, he travelled from one place to another wearing his food pan upturned on his head and carrying his trademark broom. When he entered on village, he would instantly start cleaning the gutters and roads of the village. He also told the citizens of the village that their congratulations would have to wait until his work was done. Villagers gave him money. Babaji used that for progress of physical as well as thinking of society. From the obtained money, Maharaj built educational institutions, dharmashalas, hospitals and animal shelters. He conducted his discourses in the form of Kirtans in which he would emphasize values like service to humanity and compassion. During his Kirtans, he would educate people against blind faiths and rituals. He would use Dohas by Kabir in his discourses.',

            'While historical studies discover, describe and interpret what existed in the past, there are other kinds of investigations which study, describe and interpret what exists at present. They are concerned with conditions or relationship that exist, practices that prevail, beliefs, points of view or attitudes that are held, processes that are going on, effects that are being felt and trends that are developing. The literature of such investigations includes expressions like descriptive survey, normative status or trend. The terms survey and status suggest the gathering of evidences relating to current conditions. The term normative implies the determination of normal or typical conditions or practices. The term normative survey, is generally used for the type of research that we intend to consider here and the research which proposes to ascertain what is the normal or typical condition or practice at the present time. The normative survey type of research is not peculiar to education or to other social sciences. It is a signification mode of attack in any field of knowledge where geographic distribution is involved or where the objects of any class very among themselves, that is in studying the climatic conditions of various parts of the world, or the distribution of natural resources. The survey approach to educational problems is one of the most commonly used approaches. Says my author, one of the female figures in the niche is exactly like the Venus de Madici, and so on. But you must remember that everything almost has been destroyed by the iconoclastic Mohammedan; yet the remnants are more than all European debris put together I have travelled eight year and not seen many of the masterpieces. Tell sister Lock also that there is a runined temple in forest in India, which and the Parthenon of Greece, Feggusson considers as the climax of architectural art each of its type the one of conception, the other of conception and detail. The later Mogul buildings etc., the Indo Saracenic architecture, does not compare a bit with best types of the ancients. I feel much obliged or the Bharati sent by you, and consider myself fortunate that the cause to which my humble life has been dedicated has been able to win the approbation of highly a talented ladies like you. In this battle of life, men are rare who encourage the initiator of new thought, not to speak of women who would offer him encouragement, particularly in our unfortunate land. It is therefore that the approbation of an educated Bengali lady is more valuable than the loud applause of all the men of India. May the Lord grant that may women like you be born in this country, and devote their lives to the betterment of their motherland. I have something to say in this regard.',

            'After Independence the Government of India passed the Industrial Policy Resolution in 1948. It laid down the pattern of mixed economy specifying the industrial field of public sector and private sector to operate. This Resolution envisaged a mixed economy as suitable basis for the future economic development of the country. Later on the Government of India passed another Industrial Policy Resolution in 1956. It firmly established the principle of mixed economy for achieving the objective of socialistic pattern of society keeping in view all this. The sector owned, controlled and managed by the State is known as public sector. Public sector includes strategic industries such as arms and ammunition, production of atomic energy whose development would be the exclusive responsibility of the State. The state is also responsible for the establishment of basic and key industries, such as coal, iron and steel aircraft manufacturing ship building etc. This is exclusive public sector as well. Noise pollution is an environmental issue that needs to be curbed using stringent measures. Loudspeakers also compound the menace of unchecked noise. Loudspeakers are widely used in cities and smaller towns and have become part and parcel of our life in the present day. They can be heard blaring away at social functions like birthdays, marriage ceremonies or political parties or meetings. The larger the gathering, the louder is the music and the festivities. But the ban of its use after 10 pm. is a blessing for most of the citizens. During public speeches indoors or outdoors, the loudspeaker is a useful gadget, and also a necessity. It helps sound to reach the people sitting quite far away from the podium from where a person is giving his address of speech. During election time, loudspeakers are a common fare during which automobiles and other modes of transport are seen carrying loudspeakers, propagating their parties achievements, and soliciting votes for the candidates. Politicians and party workers are seen addressing rallies or large gatherings using the loudspeakers to reach across to the remote people justifying their party stand, the merits of voting for their party, and so on. In this sense, the loudspeakers is a been. But there is hardly any need to belt out loud music or propaganda songs.',

            'As the world continues to grapple with the far-reaching impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a noticeable shift in focus towards addressing mental health challenges exacerbated by the prolonged period of stress and uncertainty. Governments, organizations, and communities worldwide are recognizing the urgent need to prioritize mental well-being and implement comprehensive initiatives to support individuals coping with pandemic-related stressors. The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on mental health globally, with millions of people experiencing heightened levels of anxiety, depression, loneliness, and other psychological distress. The disruption of daily routines, social isolation, economic hardships, and concerns about health and safety have contributed to a significant increase in mental health issues across all age groups and demographics. In response to this crisis, governments and healthcare authorities are ramping up efforts to expand access to mental health services, raise awareness, and promote self-care strategies. One notable trend is the integration of mental health support into broader public health responses to the pandemic. Governments are allocating resources to fund mental health hotlines, online counselling services, and community-based programs aimed at providing emotional support and resources to those in need. Furthermore, there is a growing recognition of the importance of destigmatizing mental illness and encouraging open discussions about mental health issues. Public figures, including celebrities, athletes, and political leaders, are using their platforms to share personal experiences with mental health challenges, reducing the stigma associated with seeking help and treatment. In addition to government-led initiatives, businesses and employers are also stepping up efforts to prioritize employee mental health and well-being. With remote work becoming the new norm for many organizations, employers are implementing policies and programs to support employee mental health while working from home. This includes offering virtual counselling sessions, mental health days, and access to resources for managing stress and anxiety. Schools and Educational institutions are also adapting to the increased mental health needs of students and faculty. Many schools are incorporating mental health education into their curricula, teaching students coping skills, resilience-building techniques, and strategies for managing stress. Additionally, schools are providing access to mental health professionals, support groups, and other resources to ensure that students feel supported and empowered to seek help when needed. Community-based organizations and nonprofits are playing a critical role in bridging gaps in mental health services and reaching underserved populations. From grassroots initiatives to large-scale campaigns, these organizations are providing invaluable support to individuals and families struggling with mental health challenges. They offer a range of services, including peer support groups, crisis intervention, and advocacy efforts to raise awareness and promote mental health literacy. Despite these positive developments, challenges remain in ensuring equitable access to mental health services and addressing systemic barriers to care. Marginalized communities, including people of colour, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those living in poverty, face disproportionate barriers to accessing mental health care due to factors such as stigma, discrimination, and lack of resources. Moving forward, policymakers, healthcare providers, and community leaders need to continue working collaboratively to address these disparities and ensure that mental health services are accessible to all who need them. This requires sustained investment in mental health infrastructure, innovative approaches to service delivery, and a commitment to addressing social determinants of mental health. In conclusion, the renewed focus on mental health initiatives in response to pandemic-related stress reflects a growing recognition of the importance of prioritizing mental well-being in public health agendas. By implementing comprehensive strategies to support individuals and communities, we can foster resilience, promote recovery, and build a healthier, more compassionate society for all.',
